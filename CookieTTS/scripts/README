# IMPORTANT !!!!
#
#  The input data should be at "16 kHz" "2 bytes per sample" "mono"
#  The program does not check the header format, so you should be very careful
#  about selecting "ifmt" option

1) Compilation
	* Goto the build directory
	* make

2) Running
	* Goto the Exe directory
        * The input needs to be at 16 kHz and mono-channel and 2 bytes per sample (uncompressed)
        * Please be careful in selecting the input file format option (mswav, nist, raw)
	* The following is an example how to run this program:

./WADASNR -i ../SampleCorrupt/sb01_10dB_Music.sph -t Alpha0.400000.txt -ifmt nist

 The -t option should be specified and please use this one Alpha0.400000.txt, which is obtained by assuming that the clean speech has the alpha of 0.4

3) There are sample examples in SampleCorrupt directories. File format is in NIST SPH format

 Thanks so much,

 Sincerley, Chanwoo Kim
