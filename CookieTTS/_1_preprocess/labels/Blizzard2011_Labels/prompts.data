( ARC_164 "There are four, all low, Mccoy answered. " )
( ARC_165 "He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way. " )
( ARC_166 "He saw all men in the business game doing this. " )
( ARC_167 "It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore. " )
( ARC_168 "He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. " )
( ARC_169 "Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. " )
( ARC_170 "What I saw I could not at first believe. " )
( ARC_171 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante. " )
( ARC_172 "His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy. " )
( ARC_173 "Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur. " )
( ARC_174 "One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer. " )
( ARC_175 "The log on which Lop-ear was lying got adrift. " )
( ARC_176 "It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. " )
( ARC_177 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him. " )
( ARC_178 "Poor little Crooked-leg was terribly scared. " )
( ARC_179 "I, I beg pardon, he drawled. " )
( ARC_180 "He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back. " )
( ARC_181 "I never saw anything like her in my life. " )
( ARC_182 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen. " )
( ARC_183 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne. " )
( ARC_184 "They saw each other for the first time in Boston. " )
( ARC_185 "Why the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil. " )
( ARC_186 "Swiftly his eyes measured the situation. " )
( ARC_187 "The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. " )
( ARC_188 "The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu. " )
( ARC_189 "Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. " )
( ARC_190 "A month in Australia would kill me. " )
( ARC_191 "He had forgotten to build a fire, and thaw out. " )
( ARC_192 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose. " )
( ARC_193 "And there was a dog that barked. " )
( ARC_194 "His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-leg by the neck. " )
( ARC_195 "Anyway, no one saw her like that. " )
( ARC_196 "But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. " )
( ARC_197 "I saw it all myself, and it was splendid. " )
( ARC_198 "Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. " )
( ARC_199 "A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came. " )
( ARC_200 "Author of the danger trail, Philip Steel, etcetera. " )
( ARC_201 "Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along. " )
( ARC_202 "There is the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. " )
( ARC_203 "His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused. " )
( ARC_204 "There is too much of the schoolboy in me. " )
( ARC_205 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness. " )
( ARC_206 "Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you. " )
( ARC_207 "Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse? " )
( ARC_208 "The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer. " )
( ARC_209 "Then came my boy code. " )
( ARC_210 "The farmer works the soil and produces grain. " )
( ARC_211 "From the source of light, a harsh voice said. " )
( ARC_212 "This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill. " )
( ARC_213 "The boy threw back his head with pride. " )
( ARC_214 "These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him. " )
( ARC_215 "May drought destroy your crops. " )
( ARC_216 "One by one the boys were captured. " )
( ARC_217 "Besides, that noise makes me deaf. " )
( ARC_218 "The boy at the wheel lost his head. " )
( ARC_219 "I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost. " )
( ARC_220 "He would destroy all things that are fixed. " )
( ARC_221 "Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way? " )
( ARC_222 "The creative joy, I murmured. " )
( ARC_223 "He was just bursting with joy, joy over what? " )
( ARC_224 "I was sick once, typhoid. " )
( ARC_225 "Typhoid, did I tell you? " )
( ARC_226 "Mccoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin. " )
( ARC_227 "Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned. " )
( ARC_228 "The boy grew and prospered. " )
( ARC_229 "The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper. " )
( ARC_230 "So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well. " )
( ARC_231 "No man ate of the seal meat or the oil. " )
( ARC_232 "By golly, the boy wins. " )
( ARC_233 "Some boy, she laughed acquiescence. " )
( ARC_234 "And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads. " )
( ARC_235 "And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house. " )
( ARC_236 "Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me. " )
( ARC_237 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist. " )
( ARC_238 "Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. " )
( ARC_239 "He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. " )
( ARC_240 "Also there was awe in their faces. " )
( ARC_241 "In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics. " )
( ARC_242 "This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place. " )
( ARC_243 "The awe of man rushed over him again. " )
( ARC_244 "It happened to him at the Gallina society in Oakland one afternoon. " )
( ARC_245 "Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself. " )
( ARC_246 "Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill? " )
( ARC_247 "Now run along, and tell them to hurry. " )
( ARC_248 "There was nothing on the rock. " )
( ARC_249 "It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis. " )
( ARC_250 "He was worth nothing to the world. " )
( ARC_251 "For such countries nothing remained but reorganization. " )
( ARC_252 "There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean. " )
( ARC_253 "We are consumed in our own flesh-pots. " )
( ARC_254 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed. " )
( ARC_255 "I tell you, I am disgusted with this adventure, tomfoolery and rot. " )
( ARC_256 "There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not. " )
( ARC_257 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day. " )
( ARC_258 "Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply. " )
( ARC_259 "Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard. " )
( ARC_260 "And that was the last of Francois and Perrault. " )
( ARC_261 "Jack London, Waikiki beach, Honolulu, Oahu. " )
( ARC_262 "All an appearance can know is mirage. " )
( ARC_263 "You are positively soulless, he said savagely. " )
( ARC_264 "A little treatment, massage, and some help from the doctor. " )
( ARC_265 "It does, was her audacious answer. " )
( ARC_266 "How does your wager look now? " )
( ARC_267 "Nobody knows how the natives got them. " )
( ARC_268 "How could he explain his possession of the sketch? " )
( ARC_269 "How can you manage all alone, Mister Young? " )
( ARC_270 "How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? " )
( ARC_271 "As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all. " )
( ARC_272 "Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged. " )
( ARC_273 "How valiantly I went at it that first day. " )
( ARC_274 "And how would we ever find ourselves? " )
( ARC_275 "For a full minute he crouched and listened. " )
( ARC_276 "But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano. " )
( ARC_277 "That is why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged. " )
( ARC_278 "Now these things had been struck dead within him. " )
( ARC_279 "Enters now the psychology of the situation. " )
( ARC_280 "He read his fragments aloud. " )
( ARC_281 "Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest? " )
( ARC_282 "Like a flash, he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl. " )
( ARC_283 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass. " )
( ARC_284 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward. " )
( ARC_285 "Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction. " )
( ARC_286 "He spat it out like so much venom. " )
( ARC_287 "Burnt out like the crater of a volcano. " )
( ARC_288 "The lines were now very taut. " )
( ARC_289 "Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed. " )
( ARC_290 "How much was it? " )
( ARC_291 "The fighting had now become intermittent. " )
( ARC_292 "Now just what do you want to know? " )
( ARC_293 "He had been born with this endowment. " )
( ARC_294 "And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him. " )
( ARC_295 "And now put yourself in my place for a moment. " )
( ARC_296 "You fired me out of your house, in short. " )
( ARC_297 "The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell. " )
( ARC_298 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe. " )
( ARC_299 "Now animals do not like mockery. " )
( ARC_300 "It was his intention to return to Eileen, and her father. " )
( ARC_301 "I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre. " )
( ARC_302 "It was sanctification and salvation. " )
( ARC_303 "To my surprise, he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor. " )
( ARC_304 "Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him. " )
( ARC_305 "Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief. " )
( ARC_306 "I have been deeply baptized. " )
( ARC_307 "She'd make a good wife for the cashier. " )
( ARC_308 "The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile. " )
( ARC_309 "Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips. " )
( ARC_310 "The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out. " )
( ARC_311 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt. " )
( ARC_312 "This time he did not yap for mercy. " )
( ARC_313 "He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger. " )
( ARC_314 "And after the bath, a shave would not be bad. " )
( ARC_315 "Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all. " )
( ARC_316 "Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred. " )
( ARC_317 "It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way. " )
( ARC_318 "Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me. " )
( ARC_319 "You're going in for grab sharing. " )
( ARC_320 "Shall I carry you? " )
( ARC_321 "Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. " )
( ARC_322 "It is the strap hangers that will keep us from going under. " )
( ARC_323 "He was an athlete, and a giant. " )
( ARC_324 "Matthewson, who is this bookkeeper, Rogers? " )
( ARC_325 "To his surprise, her answer was flat, and uncompromising. " )
( ARC_326 "He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes. " )
( ARC_327 "Cherokee identified himself with his instinct. " )
( ARC_328 "Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me? " )
( ARC_329 "Meanwhile, I'll go out to breathe a spell. " )
( ARC_330 "Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human. " )
( ARC_331 "Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai. " )
( ARC_332 "I'll tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face. " )
( ARC_333 "So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet. " )
( ARC_334 "I'd sooner have my chips back. " )
( ARC_335 "Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion. " )
( ARC_336 "It is only his indigestion I find fault with. " )
( ARC_337 "I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game. " )
( ARC_338 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said. " )
( ARC_339 "Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two. " )
( ARC_340 "I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight. " )
( ARC_341 "I can't go elsewhere, by your own account. " )
( ARC_342 "I use great trouble advisedly. " )
( ARC_343 "The apron string loomed near, and he shied like an unbroken colt. " )
( ARC_344 "White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortiber. " )
( ARC_345 "That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed. " )
( ARC_346 "Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved. " )
( ARC_347 "I saw Mister Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically. " )
( ARC_348 "We leave the eventuality to time and law. " )
( ARC_349 "He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe, and began filling it. " )
( ARC_350 "Their love burned with increasing brightness. " )
( ARC_351 "To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo. " )
( ARC_352 "He knew what taboos he was violating. " )
( ARC_353 "His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. " )
( ARC_354 "Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless. " )
( ARC_355 "It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne. " )
( ARC_356 "Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring. " )
( ARC_357 "In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining. " )
( ARC_358 "That is the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe. " )
( ARC_359 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more. " )
( ARC_360 "The mob came on, but it could not advance. " )
( ARC_361 "It was a superb picture. " )
( ARC_362 "I have been robbed, sir, I amended. " )
( ARC_363 "It was unobtrusive, yet it was there. " )
( ARC_364 "A rising tide of fat had submerged them. " )
( ARC_365 "To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself. " )
( ARC_366 "The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment. " )
( ARC_367 "I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly. " )
( ARC_368 "Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew said. " )
( ARC_369 "Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity. " )
( ARC_370 "At sea, Wednesday, March eighteenth, nineteen oh eight. " )
( ARC_371 "These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter. " )
( ARC_372 "The men stared into each other's face. " )
( ARC_373 "The emotion, which she had suppressed, burst forth now in a choking sob. " )
( ARC_374 "We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more. " )
( ARC_375 "For a much longer time Lop-ear and I remained and watched. " )
( ARC_376 "He was an enthusiast, and a desert dweller. " )
( ARC_377 "But Johannes could, and did. " )
( ARC_378 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar. " )
( ARC_379 "Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me. " )
( ARC_380 "If I meet her again, I shall apologize, said Eileen. " )
( ARC_381 "So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction. " )
( ARC_382 "The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words. " )
( ARC_383 "Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away. " )
( ARC_384 "The journey was continued at dawn. " )
( ARC_385 "We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed. " )
( ARC_386 "There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words. " )
( ARC_387 "And you preferred a cannibal isle, and a cartridge belt. " )
( ARC_388 "There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes. " )
( ARC_389 "There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green. " )
( ARC_390 "King took every advantage he knew. " )
( ARC_391 "Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence. " )
( ARC_392 "It was not a large lake, and almost round. " )
( ARC_393 "There was a change now. " )
( ARC_394 "Someone had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand. " )
( ARC_395 "But a strange thing happened. " )
( ARC_396 "Then it was that a strange thing happened. " )
( ARC_397 "As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly. " )
( ARC_398 "The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land. " )
( ARC_399 "Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another. " )
( ARC_400 "Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. " )
( ARC_401 "His slim hands gripped the edges of the table. " )
( ARC_402 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest. " )
( ARC_403 "At first his progress was slow and erratic. " )
( ARC_404 "The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant. " )
( ARC_405 "Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound. " )
( ARC_406 "He had been foiled in his attempt to escape. " )
( ARC_407 "Bassett was a fastidious man. " )
( ARC_408 "Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality. " )
( ARC_409 "Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality. " )
( ARC_410 "Gregson had seated himself under the lamp, and was sharpening a pencil. " )
( ARC_411 "And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out. " )
( ARC_412 "After all superfluous flesh is gone, what is left is stringy and resistant. " )
( ARC_413 "The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments. " )
( ARC_414 "This is my fifth voyage, your father's fifth command, he nodded. " )
( ARC_415 "Halfway around the track, one donkey got into an argument with its rider. " )
( ARC_416 "See the length of the body, and that elongated neck. " )
( ARC_417 "It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind. " )
( ARC_418 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying. " )
( ARC_419 "Joan cried, with shining eyes. " )
( ARC_420 "They likewise are disinclined to being eaten. " )
( ARC_421 "There is a big English general right now, whose name is Roberts. " )
( ARC_422 "He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner. " )
( ARC_423 "The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them. " )
( ARC_424 "Between him and all domestic animals, there must be no hostilities. " )
( ARC_425 "Tom Spink has a harpoon. " )
( ARC_426 "He was a wise hyena. " )
( ARC_427 "The hyena proceeded to dine. " )
( ARC_428 "It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into. " )
( ARC_429 "Therefore, hurrah for the game. " )
( ARC_430 "They do not know the length of time of incubation. " )
( ARC_431 "His immaculate appearance was gone. " )
( ARC_432 "Surely I will excuse you, she cried. " )
( ARC_433 "I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else. " )
( ARC_434 "The ship should be in within a week, or ten days. " )
( ARC_435 "We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more. " )
( ARC_436 "The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves, or hope to understand. " )
( ARC_437 "All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy. " )
( ARC_438 "The ringing of the big bell aroused him. " )
( ARC_439 "The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot made a natural shield. " )
( ARC_440 "There is Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep. " )
( ARC_441 "Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up. " )
( ARC_442 "He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips. " )
( ARC_443 "I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored. " )
( ARC_444 "She was built primarily to sail. " )
( ARC_445 "He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic. " )
( ARC_446 "Come on, Del Mar challenged. " )
( ARC_447 "We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once. " )
( ARC_448 "Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out. " )
( ARC_449 "There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice. " )
( ARC_450 "Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness. " )
( ARC_451 "Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia. " )
( ARC_452 "He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees. " )
( ARC_453 "You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook. " )
( ARC_454 "He was an amphibian, and a mountaineer. " )
( ARC_455 "It would give me nervous prostration. " )
( ARC_456 "Horses and rifles had been her toys, camps and trails her nursery. " )
( ARC_457 "It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits. " )
( ARC_458 "And you always want to see it in the superlative degree. " )
( ARC_459 "It is merely the simple superlative. " )
( ARC_460 "I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand. " )
( ARC_461 "Stand off, butcher and baker and all the rest. " )
( ARC_462 "It was like the beating of hoofs. " )
( ARC_463 "For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking. " )
( ARC_464 "For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face. " )
( ARC_465 "The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants. " )
( ARC_466 "The voyage was our idea of a good time. " )
( ARC_467 "Do you know any good land around here? " )
( ARC_468 "When I can't see the beauty in woman, I want to die. " )
( ARC_469 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog. " )
( ARC_470 "The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour. " )
( ARC_471 "Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite. " )
( ARC_472 "He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. " )
( ARC_473 "In the crib, the baby sat up and began to prattle. " )
( ARC_474 "The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce. " )
( ARC_475 "Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. " )
( ARC_476 "Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing? " )
( ARC_477 "Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes. " )
( ARC_478 "But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow. " )
( ARC_479 "Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm. " )
( ARC_480 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision. " )
( ARC_481 "It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio. " )
( ARC_482 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman. " )
( ARC_483 "The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed. " )

( ARC_486 "Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol. " )
( ARC_487 "The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine. " )
( ARC_488 "From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy. " )
( ARC_489 "Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly. " )
( ARC_490 "There is another virtue in these bulkheads. " )
( ARC_491 "Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him. " )
( ARC_492 "His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor. " )
( ARC_493 "He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them. " )
( ARC_494 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau. " )
( ARC_495 "I had forgotten their existence. " )
( ARC_496 "Very few people knew of the existence of this law. " )
( ARC_497 "I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah. " )
( ARC_498 "Sandel would never become a world champion. " )
( ARC_499 "He confessed that the sketch had startled him. " )
( ARC_500 "He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique. " )
( ARC_501 "Death is, and has been ever since old Maui died. " )
( ARC_502 "He wondered, too, where Roscoe was. " )
( ARC_503 "Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation. " )
( ARC_504 "He looked at the handkerchief more closely. " )
( ARC_505 "The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart. " )
( ARC_506 "For the twentieth time that evening, the two men shook hands. " )
( ARC_507 "Their supply of grub was gone. " )
( ARC_508 "Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box. " )
( ARC_509 "Your face is red with blood. " )
( ARC_510 "Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document. " )
( ARC_511 "Tomorrow, it will be strong enough for you to stand upon. " )
( ARC_512 "But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind. " )
( ARC_513 "In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius. " )
( ARC_514 "His teeth shut with a last click. " )
( ARC_515 "Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him. " )
( ARC_516 "Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man. " )
( ARC_517 "Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength. " )
( ARC_518 "Philip bent low over Pierre. " )
( ARC_519 "It is that much junk. " )
( ARC_520 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely. " )
( ARC_521 "After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment. " )
( ARC_522 "Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast. " )
( ARC_523 "His face was streaming with blood. " )
( ARC_524 "That is Thorpe's, said the young engineer. " )
( ARC_525 "If I ever needed a fighter in my life, I need one now. " )
( ARC_526 "Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her. " )

( HAW-010-00 "This book is about the unique phenomenon of long-term marriages in our society's older generation, and about the husbands and wives in those marriages who are living longer, and coping and caring for each other longer. " )
( HAW-010-01 "It is estimated that almost half of this entire generation consists of husbands and wives in marriages of approximately half a century. " )
( HAW-010-02 "This amounts to about fifteen million people who are age sixty-five and over, and who are not only living longer than ever before but also living together longer than ever before. " )
( HAW-011-00 "Since these long-term marriages did not occur in the past, except in unusual or isolated cases, there has been comparatively little serious study or attention to them. " )
( HAW-011-01 "A number of questions have been left unexplored or unanswered: " )
( HAW-012-00 "What made this possible? " )
( HAW-012-01 "What new developments or circumstances or special combinations of factors brought about such longer lasting lives and marriages? " )
( HAW-013 "What changes do the added years bring to these marriages, both to the individual husbands and wives and also to the relationships between them? " )
( HAW-014 "How do these husbands and wives cope with the changes, and how do their ongoing marital relationships shape, or become shaped by, the added years? " )
( HAW-015 "What is the cost of this gift of more time? " )
( HAW-016 "What can be learned, especially as a message to the next generation for its own marital expectations? " )
( HAW-017-00 "These are the questions this book addresses. " )
( HAW-017-01 "The book is organized into three parts, each dealing with a different aspect of long-term marriage. " )
( HAW-018-00 "Part One, Changing Times, discusses important factors directly contributing to and resulting from these lasting marriages. " )
( HAW-018-01 "The factors include the impact of human longevity on how long marriages can be and what they can be like; the effects of changes in sickness and health as people live longer and age later; and the resulting need to eventually give or receive care. " )
( HAW-021-00 "Three patterns emerge from these real human experiences. " )
( HAW-021-01 "One pattern is that living longer and being married longer bring health changes that would not have occurred, and certainly would not have been shared, if the couple's lives and marriages had been briefer. " )
( HAW-021-02 "The second pattern is that over time, these aging-related health changes inevitably and increasingly require care. " )
( HAW-021-03 "And the third pattern is that this care is provided, as much as needed and as long as needed, by the husbands and wives for themselves and for each other. " )
( HAW-021-04 "Therefore, the conclusion, which is the theme and subtitle of this book From Caring to Caretaking is that long-term marriage, in one way or another, inevitably and inescapably changes the marital relationship from caring about each other to taking care of each other. " )
( HAW-022-00 "The material in this book is derived from three major sources. " )
( HAW-022-01 "One is professional literature about the aging process written by gerontologists, psychologists, and sociologists. " )
( HAW-022-02 "Second are observations of and interviews with the twenty-four long-married couples whose stories are told here. " )
( HAW-022-03 "And third is my own personal experience of more than a half century of marriage. " )
( HAW-023-00 "This book is dedicated to my husband, Edward Hawthorne. " )
( HAW-023-01 "We have now been together as a married couple much more than twice as long as we had been apart as separate individuals. " )
( HAW-023-02 "So by this time, we no longer know which of us is the better half; but we do know that neither one of us, without the other, would be whole. " )
( HAW-024-00 "Today's older generation is the longest lived and longest married of any in our society's history. " )
( HAW-024-01 "We know that science and technology-based longevity are what have made these long lives and marriages possible. " )
( HAW-024-02 "During the last century, almost thirty years have been added to the expected lifespan, and the possible duration of marriage has been virtually doubled. " )
( HAW-024-03 "Indeed, many of these couples have now been married forty, fifty, sixty, or even more years, which is longer than people used to live only a few generations ago! " )
( HAW-025-00 "These long-term marriages are unique to today's older generation because of the special confluence of longevity and monogamy. " )
( HAW-025-01 "Longevity has made them possible, but monogamy has made them desirable. " )
( HAW-025-02 "Such long-term marriages did not occur in the last generation and may not in the next one for vastly different reasons. " )
( HAW-026-00 "In the previous generation, most men and women stayed married to each other as long as they lived, but they did not live long enough to celebrate such advanced anniversaries. " )
( HAW-026-01 "For them, the so-called silver anniversary, twenty-five years, was long-term; more was not expected and was not usual. " )
( HAW-027-00 "The shorter span of these marriages produced a kind of stability during whatever time they lasted. " )
( HAW-027-01 "Husbands and wives usually lived only into their fifties or occasionally sixties. " )
( HAW-027-02 "They worked at their jobs, raised their children, and died not long afterward. " )
( HAW-030-00 "That means they will probably not be able to celebrate wedding anniversaries of forty, fifty, or more years unless they add together the different years of their separate marriages! " )
( HAW-030-01 "Even though the baby boomers will be younger, stronger, healthier, active longer than any previous generation, they too will ultimately grow older and change with age, even if later in their lives. " )
( HAW-030-02 "And when that happens, it means that many will find themselves not in long-lasting marriages as their parents did, but merely in their last marriages. " )
( HAW-031-00 "It is only the current older generation that uniquely has both monogamy and longevity. " )
( HAW-031-01 "The previous generation experienced monogamy without longevity, and it appears that the next generation will have the reverse. " )
( HAW-032-00 "It is obvious that longevity has altered the number of years possible in people's lives and marriages, but what is less obvious is that longevity also has altered the very nature of those years. " )
( HAW-032-01 "The new years added to old marriages do not bring merely more of the same. " )
( HAW-032-02 "They bring time for changes, opportunities, and problems that would not have occurred or even been possible before. " )
( HAW-032-03 "They bring new and different circumstances and they change old and expected ones. " )
( HAW-033-00 "For example, there are certain important normal developmental changes that, in the past, occurred during the final years of marriage. " )
( HAW-033-01 "These changes are the end of full-time parenting, when children grow up and go off into separate adult lives, and the end of full-time working, when men and women retire from their out-of-home jobs and careers. " )
( HAW-033-02 "In the previous generation, there were few years left in people's lifetimes after these normal developmental changes occurred. " )
( HAW-033-04 "These are years in which husbands and wives have more time in their days and their lives to be with each other without those previous familiar occupying roles. " )
( HAW-033-05 "However, it turns out that this additional time does not bring just more years to be together, but mostly more years to be old together which is both a bonus and a burden in their lives. " )
( HAW-035-00 "For today's long-lived and long-married couples, these aging-related health changes occur precisely during those years that have now been added to their marriages: the fourth, fifth, and later decades. " )
( HAW-035-01 "Indeed, the golden anniversary, fifty years, seems to form an almost irreversible threshold for age-related health problems. " )
( HAW-035-02 "As a result, many of these supposedly celebrating couples find themselves complaining that the so-called golden years are really rather tarnished! " )
( HAW-035-03 "In other words, the longevity that has made long-lasting marriages possible has also made the aging-related health problems inevitable. " )
( HAW-036-00 "Certainly, all husbands and wives do not experience health and aging changes in the same way or at the same time or at the same rate. " )
( HAW-036-01 "Some of these changes may be slow and minor, especially at first, and only require care that is slight and minor, also at first. " )
( HAW-036-02 "But over time, as long as life continues to be prolonged, these changes and needs will also continue and, in fact, escalate. " )
( HAW-036-03 "Inevitably even if later rather than sooner, even if gradually rather than drastically, even if only one spouse more than the other, aging-related health problems will create special needs and require special care. " )
( HAW-037-00 "In addition to the personal aging changes that come with a long life, long-married couples also experience and share each other's aging changes. " )
( HAW-037-01 "So it is not only an individual's health problems that affect married life in the later years, but also the spouse's and the effect each one has on the other. " )
( HAW-038-00 "The result is that health and aging become overriding presences in a long-term marriage. " )
( HAW-038-01 "They become constant sources of concern and attention, even a controlling influence affecting in some way what these couples can do, what they can have, what they can expect, and how they can feel. " )
( HAW-038-02 "Health and aging seem to take over the last years of lasting marriages, virtually redefining what husbands and wives will now need from each other and what they will need to do for each other. " )
( HAW-039-00 "This is neither a happy nor a sad ending for these marriages, but the price paid by these husbands and wives for the gift of time they have received. " )
( HAW-039-01 "Therefore, the only way not to eventually need any special care for oneself, or not to need to give any special care to a spouse, is not to live so long or to be married so long! " )
( HAW-040-00 "The words in sickness and in health, which are such an important part of traditional marriage vows, take on new meaning and reality for long-married couples. " )
( HAW-040-01 "Concern about sickness becomes everpresent, and being well comes to mean only being well enough. " )
( HAW-042-01 "At that time, the five leading recorded causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, heart disease, and stroke. " )
( HAW-043-01 "Also, by this time, the five leading causes of death had changed to heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory disease, and accidents. " )
( HAW-045-00 "During the twentieth century, especially the latter half, major and far-reaching changes occurred in health care. " )
( HAW-045-01 "Certain illnesses, such as infections and intestinal diseases, were able to be prevented or almost eliminated through improved sanitation, diet, or inoculation. " )
( HAW-045-02 "Some illnesses, such as diabetes, were able to be mitigated through early diagnosis and treatment. " )
( HAW-045-03 "Others, such as heart damage and joint atrophy, were able to be corrected through surgery, implants, or replacements. " )
( HAW-045-04 "For strokes and other previously crippling diseases, disabling effects were able to be compensated through prostheses or orthopedic equipment. " )
( HAW-045-05 "Some severe illnesses, though not necessarily curable, became treatable; and in fatal diseases, death was able to be deferred through drugs or life-support systems. " )
( HAW-045-06 "Finally, in surgery, though still not totally risk free, serious risks became more rare even as technical possibilities became more remarkable. " )
( HAW-046-01 "As a result, people now live long enough to develop muscular or skeletal deterioration, as in osteoporosis, or irreparable sensory loss, as in macular degeneration, or severe neurological impairment, as in Parkinson's disease, or mental health damage, as in Alzheimer's disease. " )
( HAW-047-01 "Medical experts are beginning to call cancer a disease of aging, and to predict that, with longevity, people will live into ages when cancer is more and more likely to occur. " )
( HAW-048-00 "These new medical improvements are also enabling people to recover sufficiently from certain illnesses that they would not have previously survived, and to live many years afterward, even with residual effects or disabilities. " )
( HAW-048-01 "Patients no longer necessarily die of the first heart attack or immediately after a stroke or shortly after the first diagnosis of cancer. " )
( HAW-048-02 "Instead, through new treatment strategies, they may continue living, although needing and undergoing special care, and although in fragile or diminished condition. " )
( HAW-049-00 "So it is not that these older men and women suffer less illness because they are living longer; but they are suffering different kinds of illnesses and living with them longer. " )
( HAW-049-01 "This means that they are suffering more from chronic than acute health conditions. " )
( HAW-049-02 "Research studies have shown that three fourths of all people over age seventy-five have at least one, and usually more, chronic health problems of some kind or degree. " )
( HAW-049-03 "Since they are chronic, by definition they do not get better over time; they get gradually and inexorably worse. " )
( HAW-050-00 "Even though the human lifespan has increased and general fitness has improved so markedly during the past century, no one can be young and well forever. " )
( HAW-050-01 "The human body was not designed to last indefinitely nor, after some years of use, to function flawlessly. " )
( HAW-050-02 "There is no escaping the process of aging, which causes wear and tear on older bodies, which then lose their capacity to cope with illness or injury. " )
( HAW-050-03 "In other words, no matter how long or how well life is extended, ultimately it must reach a functioning limit that is foreshadowed by the onset of aging. " )
( HAW-050-04 "Noted gerontologist doctor Caleb Finch summed up by saying, Aging is an inevitable result of living, just as death is an inevitable consequence of life. " )
( HAW-051-00 "Husbands and wives both inevitably age as they live long enough, but their aging is not necessarily the same, due to individual differences and also to gender differences. " )
( HAW-051-01 "The demographics of today's older generation clearly indicate a preponderance of women, and not only are there more women than men, but they are also living longer than men. " )
( HAW-051-02 "As a result, it has been observed that adulthood, which was a world of ruling men, has now been succeeded by old age, which is a world of surviving women! " )
( HAW-052-00 "Such disparate experts as gerontologist doctor Robert Butler, psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, and feminist Betty Friedan have all agreed that women are aging better than men, defined in terms of functioning as well as longevity. " )
( HAW-052-01 "Research has shown that, with the exception of Alzheimer's disease, all of today's leading medical killers take a greater toll on older men than on older women. " )
( HAW-052-02 "In addition, women not only live longer, but also seem to retain physical and mental skills longer and stronger. " )
( HAW-053-00 "There are a number of examples and possible explanations for this. " )
( HAW-053-01 "One is that men seem to seek medical care less promptly, and are more impatient and less satisfied with that care when they receive it. " )
( HAW-053-02 "Also, aging men have more difficulty dealing with physical changes, especially those related to signs of weakness or impotence. " )
( HAW-053-03 "Perhaps because so much of their self-image and self-esteem is connected to their sense of strength and power, they see doctors later or less, since to do otherwise would be to acknowledge weakness. " )
( HAW-053-04 "In addition, it is extremely difficult for men to accept chronic health conditions; they do better in situations of acute illness, which, though sometimes more drastic, may still offer the possibility of a solution or a quick fix or a chance of change. " )
( HAW-054-00 "Men are also particularly unlikely to have emotional or social supports outside of their families, specifically their wives, or even to seek those supports when they suffer illness. " )
( HAW-054-01 "In fact, the acknowledgment of any need for emotional help may be even more difficult for men than acknowledging the need for medical help because it seems more damaging to self-esteem. " )
( HAW-055-00 "On the other hand, women may be able to turn to doctors more regularly and easily because, as mothers, they have been accustomed to taking care of the health needs of their children and families over the years. " )
( HAW-055-02 "Furthermore, since women have been accustomed to providing emotional support in their roles as family nurturers, they are more able and willing to seek emotional support for themselves when they feel it may be needed or helpful. " )
( HAW-055-03 "In other words, women seek doctors or other kinds of resources more than men do and for more health problems, and men die younger. " )
( HAW-056-00 "There have also been a number of illuminating research studies about health and aging and about gender and aging. " )
( HAW-056-01 "One recent medical finding is that for older men, there seems to be a correlation between the emergence of health problems and permanent retirement from life work or profession. " )
( HAW-056-02 "So it may be that while men are still feeling in a positive role as wage earners and producers, and receiving gratification from this, they may be more able to mask or deny or sublimate health symptoms. " )
( HAW-060-00 "Today's grown sons or daughters do not care less about their aging parents. " )
( HAW-060-03 "Until then, elderly available spouses are expected to, and do, take care of themselves or each other. " )
( HAW-061-00 "It was not that in the past some kind of caretaking was never needed, but the older generation did not usually live long enough to require it for long. " )
( HAW-061-01 "If elderly parents did need assistance, this was invariably provided by dutiful children, especially daughters. " )
( HAW-061-02 "Indeed, this was virtually an assumed obligation, and not considered an unusual or unfair burden. " )
( HAW-061-03 "The responsibility may have been regretted or even resented, but nevertheless it was expected and accepted. " )
( HAW-062-00 "There were several practical reasons for this in addition to any sense of family or moral obligation. " )
( HAW-062-01 "First of all, this was before the days of an easy mobility that physically separated parents and children. " )
( HAW-062-02 "Indeed, the generations remained geographically close to each other, usually living in the same community, the same neighborhood, sometimes even in the same home. " )
( HAW-062-03 "As a result, families were close-knit and close by. " )
( HAW-063-00 "Indeed, today's easy mobility has produced geographical separation. " )
( HAW-063-02 "The result is that, no matter how caring or concerned these children may be and usually are, they are too far away to be readily available, except for occasional crisis intervention. " )
( HAW-063-03 "They are not close enough physically to provide ongoing care. " )
( HAW-064-00 "There is another difference between caretaking then and now. " )
( HAW-064-01 "Before the days of women's independent work or careers, daughters were usually available as homemakers. " )
( HAW-064-02 "They simply added parental caretaking to their other regular family responsibilities. " )
( HAW-064-03 "Today, families are usually smaller in number than in the past, with two or three children being most typical, so fewer grown children now are available for assistance, and among those adult children, the daughters and the sons are equally employed or preoccupied outside the home. " )
( HAW-066-01 "In contrast, today's older people need both more and less care than in the previous generation. " )
( HAW-066-02 "They need less because medical improvements are keeping them stronger longer; they need more because they live longer with chronic conditions that require care longer. " )
( HAW-067-00 "Still another important reason for the change in caretaking responsibility is that today's older generation has long taught and sought independence, both for themselves and for their children. " )
( HAW-067-02 "So in a sense, they intentionally freed their children from the burden of parental obligation that they themselves had endured. " )
( HAW-067-03 "During their own younger or adult years, this was not difficult and was even satisfying. " )
( HAW-067-04 "But when they reached their older years and began to feel or expect the need for care, they also began to feel some regrets about the lessons of freedom from responsibility that they had taught and their children had learned so well! " )
( HAW-069-00 "The need to take care, or to be taken care of, in the later years of lasting marriages may be inevitable, but how the need is met is far from the same in all situations. " )
( HAW-069-01 "There are differences in marital relationships, in individual personalities, in the nature of the particular problems, in the resources available, and in which spouse is the primary patient or caretaker. " )
( HAW-069-02 "The caretakers may have health changes or problems of their own, but these are, as yet, less limiting and more manageable than the spouse's. " )
( HAW-069-03 "So for almost all couples, the differences in health conditions are obvious enough to clearly define which spouse gives the caretaking and which spouse receives it. " )
( HAW-070-00 "In either case, caretaking actually consists of two different but related kinds of responsibilities. " )
( HAW-070-01 "One responsibility involves direct patient care, the providing of food, medication, assistance, comforting. " )
( HAW-070-02 "The other involves taking over the patient's former household functions. " )
( HAW-070-03 "The extent of the second depends on the first: the more care the spouse requires, the less he or she will be able to perform former household functions. " )
( HAW-071-00 "Interestingly, it is the second set of duties rather than the direct helping that caretakers find more onerous. " )
( HAW-071-01 "Perhaps they are not accustomed to the given tasks or do not feel competent about doing them. " )
( HAW-071-03 "Or perhaps having those particular tasks reinforces the sense of loss of what the other spouse had formerly done or been in the marriage. " )
( HAW-072-00 "Among these long-married caretaking couples, four patterns can be discerned, each with its own special arrangements, expectations, possibilities, and challenges, and also each with its own experiences and stories. " )
( HAW-072-01 "These are wives taking care of husbands; husbands taking care of wives; wives and husbands taking care of each other; and not yet caretakers. " )
( HAW-073-00 "This first group is numerically the largest, primarily due to gender differences in health and aging, as previously discussed. " )
( HAW-073-01 "In addition, customarily the women were younger than the men when they married, with two or five years being the usual age difference. " )
( HAW-073-02 "Therefore, in their later years, the wives are both younger and stronger than their husbands. " )
( HAW-074-00 "In some ways, wives who take care of their husbands may find it easier than how husbands experience taking care of their wives. " )
( HAW-074-01 "For a wife in the current older generation, spousal caretaking may almost seem to be a variation or extension of her nurturing role in the family all along. " )
( HAW-074-02 "She has already been accustomed to being the provider of food, medication, support, attention, and affection. " )
( HAW-074-03 "So the specific skills and practical knowledge required are not new or unknown, even though this is a new kind of caretaking for her. " )
( HAW-077-00 "Sometimes, although usually not at first, caretaking wives have turned to adult sons or sons-in-law for advice or assistance with what had formerly been men's tasks. " )
( HAW-077-01 "But they have done so reluctantly and usually not until their husbands conditions noticeably lasted or worsened. " )
( HAW-077-02 "Until then, most wives have tried to do everything themselves. " )
( HAW-079-00 "First of all, nurturing and tending have not been things that men of the current older generation customarily have done, were expected to do, wanted to do, or were comfortable doing. " )
( HAW-079-01 "It is not that these men do not care about their wives and families, but they have defined taking care in terms of their own masculine skills of organization, management, and efficiency. " )
( HAW-079-02 "These are the skills they have been comfortable using and have tried to apply in taking care of their wives. " )
( HAW-079-03 "The skills of nurturing, patience, and empathy have been seen by both genders as the women's skills, not the men's. " )
( HAW-080-00 "Second, domestic household tasks will have been handled by the wives. " )
( HAW-080-01 "In fact, cleaning rooms, doing the laundry, shopping for groceries, and making meals were actually looked down upon by most of the husbands. " )
( HAW-080-02 "They often carefully avoided those tasks through preoccupation in their own tasks or through assumed helplessness in the kitchen or laundry room. " )
( HAW-081-00 "Third, the wives usually will have been the social managers of the families, making and maintaining friends, entertaining and accepting invitations, arranging activities with others. " )
( HAW-081-01 "Few of today's caretaking husbands feel they have the skill or experience or even the energy and patience to try to learn. " )
( HAW-081-02 "Instead, they find themselves relying increasingly for company on adult children who live nearby, or they remain without much social companionship or activities. " )
( HAW-085-00 "Love demands sacrifice, and love binds us. " )
( HAW-085-01 "Our attachments to those we love constrict us as much as they anchor us. " )
( HAW-085-02 "Our parents bound themselves in sacrifice to us when we were young; the Fifth Commandment says we should bind ourselves in allegiance to them when they are old. " )
( HAW-085-03 "Children see their worth in their parents eyes while they are growing up; parents see their worth in their children's eyes as they themselves age. " )
( HAW-085-04 "We care for our children when they are young. " )
( HAW-085-05 "We hope our children will care for us when we become old. " )
( HAW-085-06 "And so it indeed goes if all goes well. " )
( HAW-086-00 "At the end, parents may need their children to sacrifice their lives for them for a time, despite the hardships that their need imposes on them. " )
( HAW-086-01 "Parents may recognize that the ties between them and their children now bind too tightly. " )
( HAW-086-02 "When we were young, our parents held us, locked eyes with us, and gave us what they could, hoping to make good lives for us. " )
( HAW-086-03 "Now when our parents become too frail to do for themselves, they need us to care for them, comfort them, and give them the best that we can. " )
( HAW-087-00 "As the end of life nears, a parent may suspect the extent of a child sacrifice but may not know or want to know the details. " )
( HAW-087-01 "If the child is kind and caring and doesn't complain, he protects the parent from knowing the painful truth. " )
( HAW-087-02 "While he may long for freedom, the child stays silent, knowing the parent could experience that longing as a wish for his hasty death. " )
( HAW-087-03 "For a parent to believe that his child feels this way is too much to bear and too much to acknowledge. " )
( HAW-087-04 "The adult child may need to express his feelings, but he does not need to have his parent witness them. " )
( HAW-087-05 "The parent may already believe that his child is sacrificing too much. " )
( HAW-087-06 "Denial serves to blunt the parent's acute sense of imposition, preserving his dignity at the expense of the son or daughter who cares for him. " )
( HAW-087-07 "But denial has a high price. " )
( HAW-087-08 "It is painful for a child to care for a parent who seems unappreciative of the sacrifice. " )
( HAW-088-00 "This fourth group consists of younger older couples, in their late sixties or early to mid-seventies, who are still in the early stages of their aging process. " )
( HAW-088-01 "They have as yet no specific medical diagnosis to cause concern, so their lives have not changed appreciably and they are still able to do whatever, or almost as much, as they always did. " )
( HAW-090-00 "Different couples react in many different ways to these beginning signs of aging. " )
( HAW-090-01 "Some simply continue doing whatever they want to do or have always done, not making any changes in their lives or lifestyles whether due to denial or bravado or sheer optimism. " )
( HAW-090-02 "Some, willingly or reluctantly, accept the need for some changes but try to keep the changes as limited and unobtrusive as possible. " )
( HAW-090-03 "Some want to do more than ever, or do different things than they did before or that they postponed before, because they feel that their health and strength are now time-limited. " )
( HAW-090-04 "And some may try to take preemptive measures to prepare for or forestall aging-related health changes. " )
( HAW-090-05 "Although there is no assurance that any of these steps will be needed or even helpful, there is some comfort in feeling that they are taking some action, that they are at least doing something. " )
( HAW-091-00 "But, for the most part, these not yet caretaking couples try to keep their lives as much the same as possible, at least on the surface. " )
( HAW-091-01 "Partly it is what they are most comfortable with and accustomed to, but also it preserves the illusion, both for themselves and others, that things are really the same and they too are really the same. " )
( HAW-092-00 "Sunny and Everett met shortly after World War two in a teacher training program. " )
( HAW-092-01 "Sunny was studying to be a kindergarten teacher, and Everett was enrolled under the G I bill to become a physical education teacher. " )
( HAW-093-00 "They both remember those years as being the best of all possible worlds. " )
( HAW-093-01 "He enjoyed working with the boys, teaching and coaching sports; she enjoyed teaching little children and then later on, staying at home to raise their own two children. " )
( HAW-093-02 "They also enjoyed giving each other space and time to pursue their own separate interests and hobbies, arts and crafts for her and sports for him. " )
( HAW-094-00 "The income from teaching was not luxurious, but it was sufficient. " )
( HAW-094-01 "There was always time for family summer vacations, though major plans for extended travel had to be reserved until after the children were grown or after retirement. " )
( HAW-095-00 "They were never able to carry out their retirement plans, however, because Everett suffered a major heart attack. " )
( HAW-095-01 "It occurred suddenly and unexpectedly, with severe chest pains, weakness, and difficulty breathing. " )
( HAW-095-02 "He was hospitalized for a week and was diagnosed as having moderate to severe arterial blockages. " )
( HAW-095-03 "Then he recuperated for several more weeks at home with instructions for diet, medication, therapy, and rest. " )
( HAW-096-00 "At first, Everett was great, seemingly undaunted and unafraid, even telling amusing stories about his hospital experiences. " )
( HAW-096-01 "However, minor symptoms persisted. " )
( HAW-096-02 "There were occasional chest pains and recurrent fatigue. " )
( HAW-096-03 "a few years ago, and about two years after the original diagnosis, the cardiologist recommended bypass surgery, not as an emergency but as a preventive measure against future heart attacks. " )
( HAW-097-01 "But this time his reaction was very different. " )
( HAW-097-03 "Sunny watched over him and tried not to upset him with any arguments or disagreements. " )
( HAW-098-00 "Now whenever Sunny goes anywhere, Everett insists that she tell him how he can reach her, just in case. " )
( HAW-098-01 "Before going to sleep at night, he makes certain she remembers exactly where his emergency medication is, just in case. " )
( HAW-098-02 "And he has repeatedly reviewed with her all their important documents, again just in case. " )
( HAW-099-00 "His anxiety has become so contagious that their children have even broached the possibility of their parents moving closer, just in case. " )
( HAW-099-01 "At the same time they warn Sunny not to hover over Everett so much, saying that it's not good for either of them. " )
( HAW-101-00 "Lina and Jess recently celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. " )
( HAW-101-01 "It was a quiet event because they have no children or nearby family, and also for health reasons. " )
( HAW-105-00 "A few years ago, Jess began to complain about fatigue, shortness of breath, and unusual swellings in his legs that affected his walking. " )
( HAW-105-01 "Doctors visits and tests concluded with a diagnosis of beginning congestive heart failure. " )
( HAW-105-02 "Jess was treated with diuretic medication, a fluid-restricted diet, and limited physical activity. " )
( HAW-105-03 "The doctors made it clear that this was a condition that would continue and possibly worsen over time. " )
( HAW-106-00 "Over the past two years, Jess has had to be briefly hospitalized twice for what the couple calls drying out times, because his body was accumulating fluids. " )
( HAW-106-01 "When he came home after each of these episodes, he seemed a little more tired than before, as if moving on a gradual downward spiral. " )
( HAW-109-00 "They have no way of knowing when the next drying out time will occur, because there are no special advance warnings. " )
( HAW-109-01 "They don't even talk about it much, though they certainly think about it and know it will happen. " )
( HAW-110 "Meanwhile, Lina tells Jess that he is such a good patient, to which Jess usually replies, That's because I have someone who takes such good care of me! " )
( HAW-111-00 "Celia and Sam have been married sixty-four years. " )
( HAW-111-01 "They have known each other since childhood, and their parents also knew each other, so somehow it was always assumed that they would marry when they grew up which they did. " )
( HAW-111-03 "And Sam adds, with a dry humor he has been able to preserve, Our marriage is almost old enough now to collect social security! " )
( HAW-112-00 "They both come from traditional homes, and that became the pattern of their own marriage and family life. " )
( HAW-112-01 "Sam owned and operated a bakery shop in the neighborhood. " )
( HAW-112-02 "Celia stayed home to raise their four children, to keep their home immaculate and orderly, and to cook the special foods her family enjoyed. " )
( HAW-112-03 "All of these were things she enjoyed doing. " )
( HAW-112-04 "She says she never had any desire for independence or any interest in outside work as her own adult daughters and especially her granddaughters seem to have. " )
( HAW-113-00 "Celia was not even interested in learning how to drive. " )
( HAW-113-01 "She did so at Sam's insistence, but she still feels uncomfortable behind the wheel. " )
( HAW-113-02 "She was also never good with numbers, so she was pleased and relieved that Sam took responsibility for all their business and financial matters. " )
( HAW-113-03 "She never felt a need to know any of the details because she trusted Sam's decisions. " )
( HAW-114-00 "It was at the time of their sixtieth anniversary that Sam started experiencing severe and persistent vision problems. " )
( HAW-114-01 "The first treatment was cataract surgery, but his vision actually worsened afterward instead of improving. " )
( HAW-115 "Then, after consultations with specialists and various treatments that were all ineffective, the final diagnosis was macular degeneration, a progressive and incurable loss of central vision. " )
( HAW-117-00 "Celia must provide daily personal help: selecting clothes, fastening buttons and buckles, cutting and arranging food so Sam can eat unassisted. " )
( HAW-117-01 "Although her nervousness about driving has never abated, she must do all the driving for doctors visits, errands, and other activities. " )
( HAW-118-00 "Celia has also had to take responsibility for all the family paperwork, record keeping, and correspondence. " )
( HAW-118-01 "Sam works closely with her in these tasks, instructing and supervising what she has to do and write down, but she is still nervous and fearful of making mistakes. " )
( HAW-118-02 "She describes their arrangement in the following way, I'm the eyes but he's still the brains! " )
( HAW-119 "Celia feels overwhelmed sometimes because there is so much for her to do. " )
( HAW-121-00 "Their children and grown-up grandchildren are all caring and concerned but busy. " )
( HAW-121-01 "They call and visit when they can and do what they can, but Celia feels that Sam is her husband and therefore her responsibility. " )
( HAW-122-00 "The first thing you notice about Betty and Ralph is how much they look alike, both of them short, stocky, round faced. " )
( HAW-123-00 "But there is a noticeable difference in their interactions with others in public due to Ralph's severe hearing loss. " )
( HAW-123-01 "Betty interprets when others speak to him, and she also speaks for him to others. " )
( HAW-123-02 "When she does, he watches her closely and nods as if, although he may not always hear what she actually says, he knows she will be saying the right things to him and for him. " )
( HAW-124-00 "They were married during the late depression years, so they could not afford to go to college themselves. " )
( HAW-124-01 "Instead, by working and saving carefully, they made certain that their children could. " )
( HAW-124-02 "Now they are extremely proud of their daughter, who is a teacher, and their son, who is a doctor. " )
( HAW-125-00 "Ralph worked in retail sales and did reasonably well because he had such a friendly, pleasing way with people. " )
( HAW-125-01 "Betty worked for a while as a bookkeeper, only to earn extra income for their children's college educations. " )
( HAW-125-02 "She did not particularly enjoy the work but accepted it as temporarily necessary. " )
( HAW-126-00 "As soon as their children grew up and were professionally independent, Ralph and Betty felt they could retire. " )
( HAW-126-01 "They knew their own material needs were not excessive, and they wanted to have time to do some other things. " )
( HAW-126-02 "Ralph wanted to volunteer in political organizations, and Betty wanted to help in charitable organizations. " )
( HAW-127-00 "About ten years ago, Ralph started complaining about hearing loss. " )
( HAW-127-01 "At first, neither of them was concerned because they assumed it was a normal part of the aging process. " )
( HAW-127-02 "They knew that young people spoke too fast, that old people mumbled too much, and that both young and old didn't pronounce words clearly enough. " )
( HAW-127-03 "So they treated the problem with mostly good natured acceptance. " )
( HAW-128-00 "But, after a while, it became clear that Ralph's hearing loss was more severe than normal. " )
( HAW-128-01 "He was missing words and misunderstanding conversations and making mistakes because he misheard instructions. " )
( HAW-128-02 "His first reaction was to begin withdrawing from social interactions with others. " )
( HAW-128-03 "Betty and their two children insisted that he consult various hearing specialists. " )
( HAW-129-00 "He was finally told that his hearing loss was due to a nerve conduction problem that was not amenable to conventional hearing aids. " )
( HAW-129-02 "Ralph hated it. " )
( HAW-129-03 "It was inconvenient and intrusive and visible, and so he frequently forgot to carry it with him. " )
( HAW-130-00 "Both Ralph and Betty have both decided that they are too old to learn sign language. " )
( HAW-130-01 "When they're home alone together, as they are a great deal now, they know each other well enough to communicate through looks and gestures. " )
( HAW-130-02 "Betty now takes care of their personal verbal interactions with salespeople, repair people, service providers, doctors, and so on. " )
( HAW-130-03 "She is afraid to let Ralph drive by himself, in spite of his being such a good driver, because he might not be able to hear warning signals; so she either drives him wherever he needs to go or accompanies him if he drives. " )
( HAW-132-00 "Kay and Nathan have been married forty-five years. " )
( HAW-132-01 "They were both past thirty years old when they married, which was unusual in their generation when most, especially women, anticipated early matrimony. " )
( HAW-133-00 "She became interested in nature and outdoor activities, and met Nathan on a camping trip. " )
( HAW-133-01 "Like her, he was shy and quiet, enjoyed outdoor life, and was not too adept at idle social conversations. " )
( HAW-133-02 "When they met, they found an immediate compatibility. " )
( HAW-133-03 "And when they decided to marry after a brief courtship, their friends and relatives were surprised, delighted, and relieved, admitting that they had virtually given up on both of them as far as marriage was concerned. " )
( HAW-134-00 "Nathan worked as a draftsman in a construction firm, and Kay had a secretarial job in a publishing house. " )
( HAW-134-01 "As soon as they could afford it, they bought a house in the country, both of them willing to accept longer commutes to their jobs to enjoy the rural setting. " )
( HAW-135-00 "When their daughter, and only child, was born, Kay decided to stay home, explaining that she had not waited so long to become a mother not to raise her child herself. " )
( HAW-135-01 "It turned out that she was actually surprised by how much she enjoyed being a stay-at-home mother and having time to become more involved in the local affairs of their small suburban community. " )
( HAW-136-00 "It was only five years ago, when Nathan underwent a routine medical examination, that the first signs of his prostate cancer were discovered. " )
( HAW-136-01 "He was seventy-six years old. " )
( HAW-136-02 "At first, the reports were not disturbing. " )
( HAW-136-03 "Approximately half of all men Nathan's age have some prostate cancer cells, which are usually slow growing and not necessarily life threatening. " )
( HAW-136-04 "They did require treatment, and Nathan's medical care started out with periodic examinations and blood tests. " )
( HAW-136-05 "Then, after two years, he needed injections and radiation treatments, and then finally surgery. " )
( HAW-136-06 "After each level of treatment, the cancer seemed to worsen rather than improve or stabilize. " )
( HAW-137-00 "This meant frequent trips to the doctor and the hospital, both a distance away. " )
( HAW-137-01 "Also, as the treatments intensified, Nathan grew weaker and Kay had to take over more and more of the household maintenance and transportation responsibilities, in addition to Nathan's basic physical care. " )
( HAW-138-00 "By this time, their daughter urged them to sell their home in the country and move into a smaller apartment in town that would be closer to medical resources and closer to her, and would require less work and less expense. " )
( HAW-138-01 "Kay and Nathan discussed this, and finally and reluctantly agreed that it was now necessary even though it meant giving up the home that had been their family center all those years. " )
( HAW-139-00 "Since Nathan was too weak to help much, Kay had to take care of most of the moving arrangements, financial arrangements, and medical care arrangements. " )
( HAW-139-01 "The new apartment is small, but it does have a patch of garden where they have planted some flowers, and they can enjoy sitting outdoors and viewing the greenery. " )
( HAW-139-02 "It is certainly more convenient in many ways, and Kay is relieved that she is closer to her daughter and can call on her for help, though she does not want to impose. " )
( HAW-139-03 "Right now she feels that she has lost her long-time home, her old friends and familiar places, and the life she used to have, and will soon lose the husband she used to have. " )
( HAW-140-00 "Rina and Sandy, now married fifty-two years, might well be considered the odd couple because they are so different in almost every way. " )
( HAW-140-01 "She is small, wiry, and sharp featured. " )
( HAW-140-02 "He is tall and, despite his illness and severe weight loss, still broad shouldered and broad boned, with light hair and coloring that gave him his nickname, Sandy. " )
( HAW-140-03 "Rina is sharp tongued, with an intense, edgy quality about her. " )
( HAW-140-04 "She prefers being busy, especially doing things that are challenging or competitive. " )
( HAW-140-05 "Sandy, on the other hand, and now when he feels well enough, has always preferred socializing with people, joking, and sharing stories. " )
( HAW-141-00 "They have two children: a son who looks like his father but is more like his mother, and a daughter who looks like her mother but is more like her father. " )
( HAW-141-01 "Rina and Sandy laugh about this, and conclude jokingly that they must have agreed with each other at least twice in their married life! " )
( HAW-141-02 "Otherwise, they acknowledge that they have disagreed about almost everything else politics, books, movies, food, people. " )
( HAW-141-03 "They still bicker and disagree even now, but it seems to be almost a ritualized pattern, without rancor. " )
( HAW-142-00 "It was just two years ago, at the age of seventy-eight, that Sandy began to complain of a surprising loss of appetite, loss of weight, and loss of energy. " )
( HAW-142-01 "However, since he had no pain or fever or sign of infection, they assumed it was something temporary or just aging. " )
( HAW-142-02 "Yet the symptoms persisted and even worsened slightly, until Rina's insistence and impatience drove Sandy finally to see a doctor. " )
( HAW-142-03 "The first blood tests disclosed some anomalies, but x-raying and other examinations showed no clear causes. " )
( HAW-143-00 "Yet the problems continued. " )
( HAW-143-01 "Sandy was referred to other doctors and specialists of increasing reputation and also cost, and finally to a teaching hospital affiliated with a major university. " )
( HAW-143-03 "There were some experimental procedures available, but these were not advisable for Sandy because of his age. " )
( HAW-144-00 "The only recommended treatment consisted of weekly blood test monitoring, diet supplements to augment strength and appetite, and periodic blood transfusions, gradually increasing in frequency as symptoms warranted. " )
( HAW-144-01 "There was never, and still is not, any great pain, only increasing tiredness and weakness. " )
( HAW-145-01 "Rina describes it as living a double life, one up and one down. " )
( HAW-145-02 "During the down times, Sandy is almost immobilized. " )
( HAW-145-04 "Rina has gradually been taking over more of the tasks, even during the up times, and certainly during the downs. " )
( HAW-146-00 "When they are with friends, which is only during the up periods, Sandy continues to be his relaxed, charming self, pleasant and uncomplaining. " )
( HAW-146-01 "In fact, their friends are all amazed and admiring about his serenity and courage. " )
( HAW-146-02 "However, when he is home alone with Rina, he is depressed, even despairing, and is focused only on his illness and his treatments. " )
( HAW-148-00 "Margie and Jerry were high school sweethearts. " )
( HAW-148-01 "They were married right after graduation. " )
( HAW-149-00 "For Margie, you can still see the resemblance between the now tired-looking, gray-haired woman and the petite, pretty girl in the picture. " )
( HAW-149-01 "But for Jerry, there is little similarity between the broad shouldered, brawny young man in the picture and the old man now slumped in a wheelchair. " )
( HAW-150-00 "Almost ten years ago, during the period of one week, Jerry suffered first a series of minor strokes and then a major stroke from which he was initially not even expected to survive. " )
( HAW-150-01 "He did recover, but the damage from the stroke was extensive and permanent. " )
( HAW-150-02 "He lost the use of his legs and control of his lower body; his vision and speech were impaired; even the muscles of his broad shoulders and his neck and arms lost strength. " )
( HAW-151-00 "At first, Margie tried to take care of Jerry by herself, dressing, bathing, and feeding him. " )
( HAW-151-02 "It was not that she was unwilling, she explains, but she simply could not manage physically. " )
( HAW-151-03 "She has now learned, with some effort, to handle the mechanics of his wheelchair, and to get him in and out of the car. " )
( HAW-151-04 "She tries to take him with her as much as possible to stores, visits, meetings and until recently he seemed to enjoy these. " )
( HAW-152-00 "Jerry's speech is quite slurred and sometimes difficult to understand, so he has become increasingly silent, especially with company. " )
( HAW-152-01 "Instead, he seems to listen intently whenever Margie says anything and, with his eyes glued on her face, he occasionally nods in agreement or understanding. " )
( HAW-153-00 "Margie is no longer so worried about the requirements of his physical care. " )
( HAW-153-01 "Hard as those requirements are, she feels she is managing. " )
( HAW-153-02 "She is concerned now about the costs of increasing and ongoing care, though she never mentions this in Jerry's presence. " )
( HAW-153-03 "During the years of their marriage, Jerry held a number of jobs, none of them very lucrative or lasting. " )
( HAW-153-04 "It wasn't that they suffered any real deprivation they managed to raise and educate two children and were always content with whatever they had but they knew they could not afford to be careless or extravagant. " )
( HAW-153-05 "Both of their children have offered Margie some financial help whenever needed, and she has assured them that so far it is not necessary, but she is grateful for the offers. " )
( HAW-154-00 "In fact, what Margie is the most worried about now, more than either physical or financial needs, is Jerry's emotional state. " )
( HAW-154-01 "He has become very despondent, even crying sometimes, and other times lapsing into long silences and unreachable withdrawals. " )
( HAW-154-02 "When their children come to visit, he scarcely speaks to them or acknowledges them. " )
( HAW-154-03 "The only time he responds with any trace of pleasure is when the little two-year-old great-granddaughter is nearby. " )
( HAW-155-00 "One time recently, when they were alone, Jerry told Margie that she would be better off without him, that it would be better for both of them if he were dead. " )
( HAW-155-01 "He has repeated this several times since then, and Margie is struggling with how to respond. " )
( HAW-155-02 "Sometimes she pretends she didn't hear it because she doesn't know what to say. " )
( HAW-155-03 "Sometimes she tries to offer sympathy or reassurance, telling him things aren't really so bad and they still have each other. " )
( HAW-155-04 "Sometimes she's stern with him, admonishing that being so negative doesn't help either of them. " )
( HAW-155-06 "But nothing seems to have much effect. " )
( HAW-155-07 "I wish I knew what's the right thing to do or say, Margie wonders out loud. " )
( HAW-155-08 "I don't even know any more. " )
( HAW-155-09 "I wish someone could tell me, could help me. " )
( HAW-156-00 "Lucy and Jeff were a World War two romance, and how they met is indeed romantic. " )
( HAW-156-01 "They met at a serviceman's dance where she was one of the young local college girl hostesses and he was a brand new commissioned officer on leave. " )
( HAW-156-02 "She recalls how handsome he looked in his uniform. " )
( HAW-156-03 "Then she says, Sometimes I wonder whether that's what I fell in love with. " )
( HAW-156-04 "Maybe if it wasn't for the uniform and the war going on, maybe if we'd had more time, we might not have married each other. " )
( HAW-156-05 "Who knows? " )
( HAW-157-00 "Not that it has been an unhappy marriage, she insists, just not an easy one. " )
( HAW-157-01 "There have been repeated complaints and small unresolved quarrels that started way back when Lucy became pregnant soon into the marriage and quit college. " )
( HAW-157-02 "She never went back to school, even later on when both of their sons were older, and she thinks that Jeff's criticisms grew out of what he saw as her lack of ambition. " )
( HAW-159-00 "Then, about five years ago, Jeff suffered a massive stroke, which the doctor said was almost no surprise given his high blood pressure and excitable temperament. " )
( HAW-159-01 "The impact of the stroke was physical not mental; his mind, speech, memory, and senses all remained intact, but the right side of his body was seriously damaged. " )
( HAW-159-02 "His right arm became numb; he couldn't move or control the fingers of his right hand; his right leg sagged or dragged when he tried to stand or walk. " )
( HAW-160-01 "Lucy recalls his efforts with a combination of admiration and pity. " )
( HAW-160-02 "There was some slight improvement during the first year, but after that the improvements stopped, though his efforts did not. " )
( HAW-160-03 "At this time, Jeff uses double crutches to walk but adamantly refuses a wheelchair even when he is tired. " )
( HAW-160-04 "He has taught himself to use his left hand for some things: eating, writing, washing, dressing though these activities are difficult and slow. " )
( HAW-161-00 "Lucy describes herself as feeling torn between trying to assist him when he has difficulty or leaving him alone to struggle and perhaps succeed or fail. " )
( HAW-161-01 "Either way, she says, there are problems. " )
( HAW-161-02 "If she tries to do things for him, he is angry and impatient with her for being slow or clumsy; but if she doesn't try, he becomes angry at his own weakness and helplessness, and lashes out at her. " )
( HAW-161-03 "So she feels torn between pity and anger, and she is never sure about the right thing to do. " )
( HAW-163-00 "Privately she complains, I know he's angry about what happened to him, and I don't blame him. " )
( HAW-163-01 "But why is he angry at me? " )
( HAW-163-02 "I didn't do it to him. " )
( HAW-163-03 "I'm only trying to help. " )
( HAW-164-00 "Linda and Alan have been married for sixty-two years, most of them, she declares emphatically, very good! " )
( HAW-164-01 "They always had a lot in common. " )
( HAW-164-02 "They shared interests in art and music, tastes in food and wine, opinions on politics, and they had similar low-key personal styles. " )
( HAW-165-00 "When Alan returned from service in World War two, they started their family. " )
( HAW-165-01 "Now their two children, four grandchildren, and two little great-grandchildren are all sources of joy. " )
( HAW-165-02 "They also worked together in a small, successful home decorating business. " )
( HAW-165-03 "He took care of the finances and purchasing while she took care of the designs and customer relations. " )
( HAW-165-04 "So they looked forward to enjoying a comfortable retirement when they sold their business. " )
( HAW-167-00 "Neurological tests revealed the beginning of Parkinson's disease. " )
( HAW-167-01 "The doctor prescribed medication in the form of occasional tranquilizers to be taken as needed, but warned that the illness would get worse over time. " )
( HAW-167-02 "It could end up affecting his legs as well as his hands, and could diminish normal movement. " )
( HAW-167-03 "The neurologist called the disease a beast that grows fiercer. " )
( HAW-168-00 "Still another blow was yet to fall. " )
( HAW-168-01 "Three years ago, Alan started forgetting things, such as instructions or requests or messages. " )
( HAW-168-02 "He had difficulty with computations, even adding or subtracting; and sometimes he didn't recognize people or places he knew. " )
( HAW-168-03 "The neurologist explained that it was not unusual for Parkinson's disease, as it worsened, to affect memory and comprehension and that all of these would be progressive. " )
( HAW-168-04 "Linda still remembers the rage she felt about that second prognosis. " )
( HAW-168-05 "Wasn't one punishment enough? " )
( HAW-168-06 "Why this one too? " )
( HAW-169-00 "By this time, the shock and anger have subsided into a routine for the two of them. " )
( HAW-169-01 "Linda takes responsibility for all the driving, shopping, budgeting, and domestic chores plus the occasional social activities with family members and a few close friends. " )
( HAW-169-02 "Out of years of habit, she still tries to discuss things with Alan or ask his opinions. " )
( HAW-169-03 "He accepts whatever she suggests with a gentle smile, but she really isn't certain how much he understands. " )
( HAW-170-00 "She is reluctant to leave him alone anymore, even at home, because she worries that he might not remember to eat or take his medication. " )
( HAW-170-01 "Sometimes friends or family members visit or baby-sit so she can get out to do some things for herself and by herself. " )
( HAW-170-02 "She has learned to savor the late night hours, after Alan has gone to sleep, when she can be relaxed and alone to read or just think; she calls this my time. " )
( HAW-171-00 "Linda is grateful that Alan is not suffering any apparent pain, and that he has not experienced any stark personality or mood changes, which the neurologist had warned might happen. " )
( HAW-171-01 "In fact, he seems to be simply more of what he always was: gentle, kind, and agreeable. " )
( HAW-172-00 "It helps, she has found, to remember all the good times and the good years, and she points out that there were a lot of them. " )
( HAW-172-02 "What I hope is that it will happen slowly and take so long that neither one of us will live that long. " )
( HAW-173-00 "Martha and Stan's long-term marriage has not turned out to be what either of them first wanted or expected, but Martha is someone who prides herself on facing reality rather than indulging in reminiscences or regrets. " )
( HAW-173-01 "Probably what first changed their marriage was that they did not, or could not, have children even though they hoped and tried for several years. " )
( HAW-173-02 "In those days, she points out, there weren't all those medical procedures like they have now for infertility. " )
( HAW-173-03 "There was only adoption, and neither one of us wanted to raise someone else's child if we couldn't have our own. " )
( HAW-174-00 "After that, they both seemed to redirect their lives in different ways. " )
( HAW-174-01 "Stan invested with business partners in a company that manufactured women's fashions. " )
( HAW-174-02 "He worked hard. " )
( HAW-174-03 "The more he worked, the more the business prospered, and the more it prospered, the more he worked. " )
( HAW-174-04 "The successful business was what afforded them their attractive home and elegant possessions, but they got to spend very little time together. " )
( HAW-175-00 "Martha became involved in various civic, cultural, and philanthropic community organizations. " )
( HAW-175-01 "She also found herself, as an only child, responsible for her widowed, ailing mother, who eventually had to be placed in a nursing home. " )
( HAW-175-02 "In addition, since Stan was so occupied in his business, Martha began taking brief vacations by herself, and to her surprise, she found herself enjoying them. " )
( HAW-176-00 "Five years ago, at the time of his seventy-fifth birthday, Stan decided it was time to retire so that the two of them could finally have some time together. " )
( HAW-176-01 "He called it his birthday present to himself, but it was shortly afterward that the symptoms began. " )
( HAW-177-02 "Also, since he had always been so quiet anyway, these behaviors did not seem so unusual as to be alarming. " )
( HAW-178-00 "However, there were two drastic, cautionary incidents that changed things. " )
( HAW-178-01 "In the first one, Stan could not remember where he had parked his car, and Martha had to be summoned to find it for him. " )
( HAW-178-02 "The second time, Stan became confused and lost while driving home from a place he had journeyed to and from many times. " )
( HAW-178-03 "This time, the police were involved, and again Martha had to be called. " )
( HAW-179-00 "As a result of these incidents, Martha took two immediate actions. " )
( HAW-179-01 "First, she insisted that Stan promptly see a doctor even though he protested that he was really all right, only tired. " )
( HAW-179-02 "And second, she confiscated his car keys, and told him he was not ready to drive by himself for a while. " )
( HAW-180-00 "When Stan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Martha was not shocked because it was what she had come to suspect and fear. " )
( HAW-180-01 "Since then, the symptoms have gradually but perceptibly worsened. " )
( HAW-180-02 "Sometimes Stan forgets how to use simple utensils and has to be fed or helped to eat; a few times he has wandered out of the house and fortunately was found by neighbors who brought him home safely; and sometimes he doesn't even recognize Martha and insists that she's someone else. " )
( HAW-181-00 "At this time, Martha has made arrangements for an attendant to take care of Stan every morning; bathing, dressing, and feeding him. " )
( HAW-181-01 "This gives her some time just for herself without pressure of responsibility. " )
( HAW-181-02 "There's no sense in being a martyr, Martha explains. " )
( HAW-181-03 "I have to take care of myself if I'm going to be able to take care of him. " )
( HAW-182-00 "She also admits that she doesn't know how long they will be able to manage this way. " )
( HAW-182-02 "In fact, she speaks about when it may happen, not if. " )
( HAW-182-04 "I'll do whatever I have to. " )
( HAW-182-05 "And then she adds, I always have. " )
( HAW-183-00 "Nell and Martin met shortly before the end of World War two while he was still in the service. " )
( HAW-183-01 "He was assigned to a special training program that was located on the campus of a small college where she was a freshman student. " )
( HAW-183-03 "All the guys were after her, and I was the lucky one she picked. " )
( HAW-183-04 "It was clear that this was a familiar and pleasing family story. " )
( HAW-183-05 "Indeed, there is still something of the pretty young girl about Nell; her features are attractive, her figure is slim, her smile is youthful. " )
( HAW-184-00 "They were married shortly after the war ended. " )
( HAW-184-01 "Nell never completed college, preferring to stay home to be a full-time wife and then a full-time mother when their twin sons were born. " )
( HAW-184-02 "The boys were healthy and active, and Nell says appreciatively that she would never have been able to handle them without Martin's help. " )
( HAW-184-03 "Working as a real estate salesman, Martin was able to arrange his schedule and appointments to be available to help Nell at home as much as possible. " )
( HAW-184-04 "Later, when the boys were older, he expanded his schedule to work more hours, but he still tried to be available. " )
( HAW-185-00 "Nell refers to her sons, and even to Martin, as her boys. " )
( HAW-185-01 "The sons, of course, are grown men now, with homes and families of their own. " )
( HAW-185-02 "They have remained close to their parents, living nearby and celebrating all the special occasions together, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations. " )
( HAW-187-00 "Nell describes herself as an obedient patient, probably because she was too numb to think about doing otherwise. " )
( HAW-187-02 "Martin assists her with many household tasks, monitors her to make certain she doesn't do too much, and makes sure that she takes her medication regularly. " )
( HAW-187-03 "The sons and their wives visit frequently and follow her progress closely. " )
( HAW-188-01 "But now Martin has no desire for socializing. " )
( HAW-188-02 "He has none of Nell's social skills, and he also knows that even visiting or entertaining can be tiring for her. " )
( HAW-188-03 "Instead, he has found it easier and safer for them just to draw more closely together into their own little family circle. " )
( HAW-189-00 "During the first year after the surgery, Nell tried joining a cancer survivors group but found it too depressing. " )
( HAW-189-01 "All they wanted to talk about was being sick and being sad, and I didn't want that! " )
( HAW-189-02 "she explains. " )
( HAW-190-00 "The doctor has told them that five years is an important landmark in breast cancer recovery, and that the odds of long-term survival improve considerably after that. " )
( HAW-190-01 "Nell is not quite there yet, and feels she is still on what she calls probation. " )
( HAW-190-02 "But recently, as they approach the end of that five-year period, she has begun talking about buying herself new clothes. " )
( HAW-190-03 "Martin is very pleased and relieved by this because, up till now, she has been unwilling to make any plans or even any purchases for the future. " )
( HAW-191 "Edith and Jack first met almost fifty years ago on a blind date, and now she points out the irony of what has happened since then to her vision. " )
( HAW-192-01 "Of course, that meant they were never able to see the beginning of any movie! " )
( HAW-195-00 "Edith and Jack have gone to the best eye doctors in the best eye clinics, and they have consulted counselors at the Braille Institute. " )
( HAW-195-01 "They have received support and suggestions but no hope. " )
( HAW-198-00 "Since that time, Jack has tried his hand at the cooking, but he readily agrees that nothing comes out right or tastes right. " )
( HAW-198-01 "They have tried to eat meals out or to bring in take-out food, but these solutions have turned out to be expensive and inconvenient. " )
( HAW-198-02 "Finally, Jack has suggested hiring someone just for a few hours each week to do the cooking but to Edith this is the most intolerable option of all. " )
( HAW-198-03 "It is not the loss of privacy that upsets her so much as it is the pain of seeing a stranger take over her role in her kitchen in her home. " )
( HAW-199-00 "So it has become increasingly difficult for both of them. " )
( HAW-199-01 "No matter how much or how hard Jack tries to do things, Edith is never really pleased. " )
( HAW-199-02 "And no matter how much or how hard she tries to appreciate what he does, she can never really lessen her despair. " )
( HAW-200-00 "The only solution Edith sees now is for them to move into an assisted living facility where all the necessary household services will be provided without struggle or inconvenience or constant reminder of disability. " )
( HAW-200-01 "She is convinced that she would be less unhappy in such an arrangement, and also that it would be better for Jack as well because he would have less responsibility, less pressure or work, and less need to worry about her. " )
( HAW-202-01 "So meanwhile, Edith and Jack still disagree, still feel frustrated and upset, and both seem to be almost waiting for something to happen that will somehow change one of them or the other. " )
( HAW-203-00 "For Lily and Herb, their long-term marriage actually started out as a long-distance one. " )
( HAW-203-01 "They were married midway during World War two, when he came home on furlough before being sent overseas. " )
( HAW-203-02 "They didn't see each other again for almost two years, when the war ended and he came home. " )
( HAW-204-00 "During the time they were apart, Lily gave birth to their son and then she went to live with her mother, who took care of the baby while Lily worked in a defense plant. " )
( HAW-204-01 "This was the beginning of a pattern of separateness that lasted most of their married life, until just a few years ago. " )
( HAW-205-00 "After the war, they continued the same living and working arrangements so that Herb could complete his college degree in economics, which he had begun before going into the service. " )
( HAW-205-01 "He did so well that he was offered a job in a prestigious and well-paying accounting firm. " )
( HAW-205-02 "After a while, Lily quit working, and they moved into their own independent place, first a small apartment, then a small house, and finally a large house. " )
( HAW-206-00 "However, Herb's job occupied him fully, including evenings and weekends when he often worked late in the office or in the small office he created for himself at home. " )
( HAW-206-01 "Sometimes he had to travel for extended periods on behalf of his company, leaving Lily feeling once again like a single parent. " )
( HAW-206-02 "She tried going with him on some of these business trips but found that she was left alone so much, while the men were preoccupied with meetings and discussions, that she decided it was easier for her to be alone at home than in these strange places. " )
( HAW-207-00 "Herb encouraged her to develop and pursue her own interests and activities. " )
( HAW-207-01 "He taught her how to drive and bought her a car. " )
( HAW-207-02 "He encouraged her to have women friends, to join clubs, to attend social or cultural events, to take classes but always without him. " )
( HAW-207-03 "He himself had no interest in, or patience with, what he considered aimless social chatter, and he did not enjoy being with people whom he did not know or care about much. " )
( HAW-208-00 "Mostly, he preferred reading or working undisturbed on his own projects. " )
( HAW-208-01 "Even after he retired, he was still invited to professional conferences and seminars. " )
( HAW-208-02 "It was certainly a different marital pattern than any of the other couples they knew, but it was one they had become accustomed to over the years. " )
( HAW-209-00 "Then, four years ago, Lily suffered a sudden neurological incident in which she lost consciousness temporarily and had to be hospitalized for a few days. " )
( HAW-209-01 "This was eventually diagnosed as a seizure plus a mild stroke. " )
( HAW-209-02 "Neurological tests including M R I, E E G, and brain scans indicated some slight brain damage and also some physical weakness on one side. " )
( HAW-209-03 "She was placed under medical care and was prescribed anti-seizure medication and physical therapy. " )
( HAW-210-00 "The effects of the seizure were neither life threatening nor dramatically disabling, but what Lily has felt most of all is the impact on her short-term memory. " )
( HAW-210-01 "It is harder for her to absorb or retain new information, especially new facts. " )
( HAW-210-02 "She forgets things easily, sometimes even what she has just said or heard, so conversations may take some repeating or reminding. " )
( HAW-210-03 "As a result, her speech and responses are slow, and she feels self-conscious and apologetic about them. " )
( HAW-211-00 "Their son, who is now almost middle-aged, lives in another state. " )
( HAW-211-01 "They have not had a close relationship with him for a long time, but he came to visit Lily when she was in the hospital and he has called his parents more frequently ever since then. " )
( HAW-212-02 "He also goes with her for long walks every day, the walks having been recommended by the doctor to try to strengthen the weakened side of her body. " )
( HAW-213-00 "Without even discussing it, they now find themselves in a totally new routine with each other, and they spend more time together then they ever did in almost their entire married life. " )
( HAW-213-02 "They both seem to recognize that the long-term pattern of their marriage has been irrevocably altered. " )
( HAW-213-03 "Once, when Lily mentioned this, Herb simply shrugged and said, It's all right. " )
( HAW-213-04 "We all have to do whatever we have to do. " )
( HAW-214-00 "Bonnie and Simon have lived in their home for more than forty years, and for most of that time they were probably the most popular couple in the neighborhood. " )
( HAW-214-01 "Bonnie was the outstanding cook, hostess, and volunteer who baked cookies for school events, led their daughter's Brownie troop, and served at neighborhood birthday parties. " )
( HAW-214-02 "Simon assisted their son's Cub Scout troop, led the boys on hikes, and repaired the neighborhood children's bicycles. " )
( HAW-214-03 "Even after all the neighborhood children grew up and moved away, Bonnie and Simon continued doing the same for the next generation. " )
( HAW-215-00 "Then, almost ten years ago, Bonnie fell on the driveway outside their home and severely fractured her arm. " )
( HAW-215-01 "Emergency surgery was performed to reset the fracture, but the arm did not heal, and it remained weak, painful, and misshapen. " )
( HAW-215-02 "The orthopedist suggested a second surgery but first arranged for some further tests, and a scan disclosed the presence of bone cancer. " )
( HAW-216-00 "This was the beginning of years of treatment that escalated as the cancer metastasized to the other arm and then to one leg. " )
( HAW-216-01 "There was more surgery, followed by radiation and several series of different kinds of chemotherapy, each of which was only temporarily effective. " )
( HAW-216-02 "Two years ago, when their children held a fiftieth anniversary party for them, Bonnie was confined to a wheelchair. " )
( HAW-216-03 "She had lost her hair due to the chemotherapy, and her grandson gave her a baseball cap that she wore jauntily, visor backward like all the boys did. " )
( HAW-217-00 "Simon retired from his job in an engineering firm and took over responsibility for the household. " )
( HAW-217-01 "The first thing he did was rearrange the rooms for patient care. " )
( HAW-217-02 "The family room next to the kitchen was converted into a combination bedroom and sitting room, with a hospital bed for her, a bed for himself, a large television set, and some chairs for visitors. " )
( HAW-217-03 "The upstairs rooms were virtually closed off except to accommodate visiting children or grandchildren. " )
( HAW-217-04 "Simon installed a call button system so Bonnie can summon him if he is in another part of the house. " )
( HAW-217-05 "He also purchased a van with special equipment to manage the wheelchair for when he has to take Bonnie to the doctor, the only time now that she leaves the house. " )
( HAW-218-00 "Simon has hired someone to do the housecleaning, but he takes care of most of the other chores himself. " )
( HAW-218-01 "He looks on it as almost a challenge to his technological skills, and he has organized and computerized all Bonnie's recipes, grocery supplies, and shopping lists. " )
( HAW-218-02 "The visiting nurse comes three times a week to monitor and bathe Bonnie and to give her chemotherapy injections. " )
( HAW-218-03 "The nurse has also instructed Simon in how to do these things, if necessary, and he has organized a notebook record of Bonnie's illness over the past ten years, including all her medications, treatments, tests, and test results. " )
( HAW-219-01 "However, visitors have now become much fewer and do not stay long. " )
( HAW-219-02 "Partly this is because Bonnie tires so easily, especially after treatments, but it is also because seeing Bonnie in this condition makes visitors feel too sad or uncomfortable, and there are so few things they can talk about with her now. " )
( HAW-219-03 "Their daughter who lives nearby visits several times a week for what she calls mother sitting. " )
( HAW-220-00 "Those who know Bonnie marvel at her perseverance, but they are also mystified by her willingness to undergo all these different kinds of treatments, including experimental ones, that cause so many difficult and debilitating side effects. " )
( HAW-220-03 "And Simon quietly adds, If that's what Bonnie wants, that's the way it's going to be. " )
( HAW-221-00 "Ella and Lewis have been married forty-eight years. " )
( HAW-221-01 "He is ten years older than she is but looks even older than that. " )
( HAW-221-02 "While she is slim, smooth cheeked, and scarcely graying, he is balding, somewhat stooped, and weary looking. " )
( HAW-221-03 "Indeed, there is something not only youthful but almost childlike in the way she smiles and sits quietly with her hands folded in her lap. " )
( HAW-221-04 "Meeting Ella for the first time, it seems that there is something not quite right, but it's hard to tell what. " )
( HAW-222-00 "When they first met, Ella was the sheltered daughter of a well-to-do family, and Lewis was already a successful practicing attorney. " )
( HAW-222-01 "After they married, she became what he calls the unpaid secretary and social partner in his legal practice. " )
( HAW-222-02 "She made telephone calls for him, scheduled appointments, kept the office attractive, helped soothe disgruntled or distressed clients, and entertained important local business or political figures. " )
( HAW-224-00 "During the first few years of their marriage, Ella suffered several miscarriages, but the doctors were never able to uncover any significant medical reason. " )
( HAW-224-01 "Eventually, the couple gave up trying and stopped hoping to have children. " )
( HAW-225-00 "It was about a dozen years ago, while Ella was still only in her fifties, that she started experiencing beginning symptoms that the doctors would later term early onset Alzheimer's disease. " )
( HAW-225-01 "It started with forgetting people's names and then forgetting who they were or that she even knew them. " )
( HAW-225-02 "Sometimes she forgot what she wanted to say or had even begun to say. " )
( HAW-226-00 "At the beginning, she was embarrassed and tried to hide the forgetfulness or to make excuses, but the lapses soon became too frequent and obvious. " )
( HAW-226-01 "Lewis took her to all the specialists who were recommended, which included internists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and gerontologists, and all concurred in the diagnosis of some form of beginning dementia. " )
( HAW-226-02 "Ella was prescribed medication that might slow the progression down, but it could not stop or alter the direction of the disease. " )
( HAW-227-00 "At first, Ella was extremely upset about what was happening to her. " )
( HAW-227-01 "In fact, one year on her birthday, when she had blown out the candles on a lavish cake and Lewis asked what she had wished for, she answered, I wished for a new head! " )
( HAW-227-02 "But later on, as the symptoms worsened, she actually became less upset, as if she no longer really knew what was happening to her or what it meant. " )
( HAW-228-00 "She can now no longer sustain a conversation, make a decision, or answer a question except about what she is specifically doing at this particular moment. " )
( HAW-228-01 "She obeys instructions passively, and seems content to sit quietly, especially when Lewis is with her. " )
( HAW-229-00 "Lewis has hired a housekeeper who also serves as an attendant for Ella when he is not home. " )
( HAW-229-01 "On the days he is home, he takes Ella out to lunch, which delights her because she enjoys dressing up and seeing the people and eating different desserts. " )
( HAW-229-02 "He says wistfully that she is now almost like the little girl they never had! " )
( HAW-230-00 "What concerns him most is not the present but the future. " )
( HAW-230-01 "The doctors have told him that, because Ella is comparatively young to be at this stage of Alzheimer's disease, and is still physically healthy, she can live this way for many years; and given his age, it means that she may outlive him by a long time. " )
( HAW-230-02 "They have no children or close relatives to take responsibility; therefore Lewis has made arrangements with a lawyer friend to serve as legal executor of their estate in case of his own death, and has specified funds and arrangements for Ella's continuing care. " )
( HAW-230-03 "He describes this very matter-of-factly, almost in legalese terms, and concludes, I think I've taken care of everything I can. " )
( HAW-231-00 "Dora and Mickey have been married fifty-eight years, and they both describe their marriage as strong if not always smooth. " )
( HAW-231-01 "He admits to having a short fuse, quick to anger or excitability; while she describes herself as Miss Sunshine who tries to cheer things up and calm things down. " )
( HAW-231-02 "She sums up by saying, He's a yeller and I'm a smiler, but by now, we both know exactly what the other one means. " )
( HAW-232-00 "They first met during World War two when they lived in the same big city neighborhood, but she was only a teenager at the time and too young to date. " )
( HAW-232-01 "He enlisted in the army, and by the time he came home from the war, she had grown into a tall, attractive, almost young woman. " )
( HAW-232-02 "Right after her eighteenth birthday, they eloped. " )
( HAW-234-01 "There was another younger child, a little boy, who died in infancy of meningitis. " )
( HAW-234-02 "They rarely talk about him because, even after all these years, it is still painful for Dora, and Mickey gets upset when he sees her upset. " )
( HAW-235-00 "After they sold the store and retired, they enjoyed their leisure time for only a few years before they both started experiencing health problems. " )
( HAW-235-01 "Dora developed rheumatoid arthritis, which caused swelling and pain in her fingers, hands, and knees. " )
( HAW-235-02 "One knee became so painful that it was difficult to walk, and she had to undergo knee replacement surgery. " )
( HAW-235-03 "And now one hip has become affected, and the rheumatologist is recommending hip replacement surgery. " )
( HAW-235-04 "Dora ruefully refers to herself as turning into a bionic woman. " )
( HAW-235-05 "She is rarely totally pain free, but she doesn't want to take prescribed pain medication too much or too often because she becomes sleepy or disoriented. " )
( HAW-236-01 "Since then, Mickey has been under regular medical care, takes medication, and always carries nitroglycerine pills for emergencies. " )
( HAW-236-02 "He has continued to experience some minor incidents, and the doctor has cautioned that he must try to learn to take things more easily and calmly if he is to avoid a worse angina attack in the future. " )
( HAW-236-03 "Mickey finds this advice bitterly amusing. " )
( HAW-236-06 "Should I make myself over? " )
( HAW-236-07 "Should I make my life over? " )
( HAW-237-00 "Dora and Mickey are both aware of, and worried about, each other's health problems, and they try to protect one another by being secretive or silent about their own problems. " )
( HAW-237-01 "Because he doesn't want to upset her, Mickey tries not to complain about any feelings of tiredness or weakness, and often assures her that he is all right even when he really is not. " )
( HAW-237-02 "And because she doesn't want to upset him, Dora tries not to complain about her own pain, and so she too sometimes lies about how she is feeling. " )
( HAW-237-03 "Yet they know each other so well that, deep down, they can usually tell when the other one is suffering, even if there is nothing they can do about it. " )
( HAW-238 "Their daughter is extremely concerned but also exasperated by her parents. " )
( HAW-239-00 "She has urged them to stop playing games with each other and being so protective, to be more honest about their pains and their needs. " )
( HAW-239-01 "Dora and Mickey appreciate her concern but continue to ignore her advice. " )
( HAW-241-00 "Bess is a small woman, neat and graying, earnest and soft-spoken; Mel is also short, but muscular, and gives the impression of being a man of few words, or at least one who prefers to say few words. " )
( HAW-241-01 "Bess describes the two of them without apology or complaint, as ordinary people who had ordinary lives. " )
( HAW-241-02 "She says that they never did anything important or special, they just always tried to be good people. " )
( HAW-241-03 "One thing they are both proud of is that the two of them, who barely finished high school themselves, were able to ensure that both of their children went to college and had more opportunities than they had. " )
( HAW-242-00 "Before his retirement, Mel worked as a dispatcher for a long-distance trucking company, a position he had moved up to after several years of on-the-road driving. " )
( HAW-242-01 "He appreciated the better salary and regular hours of the new position, but he actually missed some of the freedom he had enjoyed being on the road on his own. " )

( HAW-243-00 "Throughout most of her adult years, Bess has had high blood pressure and has taken medication to keep it under control. " )
( HAW-243-01 "Her mother also suffered from serious high blood pressure and eventually died of a resulting stroke so Bess has been conscientious about monitoring her diet, salt intake, and medication. " )
( HAW-243-03 "She seems to have recovered completely as far as symptoms indicate; but what she does feel and worry about is the unnerving fear of a recurring stroke. " )
( HAW-244-00 "On the other hand, Mel's health was remarkable because it was so unremarkable. " )
( HAW-244-01 "He never got sick, never had any complaints, hardly ever went to see doctors, didn't take any regularly prescribed medication, and boasted of his cast iron stomach that digested anything he ate or drank. " )
( HAW-244-02 "He never paid any attention to his health, and therefore neither did she. " )
( HAW-245-00 "Two years ago, just about the time of his eightieth birthday, Mel began complaining of fatigue, which was out of character for him. " )
( HAW-245-01 "He also noticed an unusual swelling of his legs. " )
( HAW-245-02 "He dismissed these symptoms and insisted they would go away, but then he experienced some urinary bleeding. " )
( HAW-245-03 "At this point, Bess and their children insisted that he see a doctor. " )
( HAW-245-04 "After a number of examinations and procedures, it was learned that he had a tumor on one of his kidneys, and a biopsy showed it to be malignant. " )
( HAW-246-00 "Mel's general health was otherwise good, so surgery was performed to remove the diseased kidney. " )
( HAW-246-01 "The surgery was successful, but the recuperation was slow, and his previous secure feeling of strength never completely returned. " )
( HAW-246-02 "He now has to maintain a strict diet, monitor fluid intakes carefully, take frequent blood tests, rest more at home, and see his doctor regularly. " )
( HAW-247-00 "Bess has been as conscientious in taking care of Mel's health as she has always been with her own. " )
( HAW-247-01 "She worries about whether he is eating or sleeping enough; she measures and monitors all his liquids; she watches to see that he takes his medications and follows the doctor's instructions. " )
( HAW-247-02 "He complains that she's making too much of a fuss, but nevertheless he has been an accepting, if unhappy, patient. " )
( HAW-248-00 "They are both trying hard but still struggling with these new circumstances while settling into a reciprocal routine. " )
( HAW-248-01 "Bess knows that she is no longer the exclusive or primary patient in the family and can no longer rely unquestioningly on her husband to take care of her. " )
( HAW-248-03 "It is as if they are both trying to figure out how much help they can or should give to each other, and also how much help they can or should expect to receive from each other. " )
( HAW-248-04 "Even their adult children have felt this change because they now worry about both of their parents, not just one of them. " )
( HAW-250-00 "They are both still tall and handsome people, although illness and weight loss have sharpened Bert's features and made Claire look frail. " )
( HAW-250-01 "There is still a kind of affectionate bantering between them, and occasional flashes of humor from Bert who tries to keep their conversations as light as possible. " )
( HAW-251-00 "Both of them agree that those first fifty years of marriage were happy and successful, and any problems they recall now seem trivial, almost amusing. " )
( HAW-251-01 "There were the efforts and exasperations of raising four sons, all of them now tall, strapping men. " )
( HAW-251-02 "There were the vociferous political arguments between a conservative Bert and a liberal Claire at every election their votes canceled each other out. " )
( HAW-251-03 "And there was the nuisance for Claire, as the only female in a household of five men, of never finding the toilet seat down! " )
( HAW-252-00 "They always had a close and easy relationship with their sons and daughters-in-law, and the four brothers also got along well with one another. " )
( HAW-252-01 "In fact, for years, there was a family tradition of once each month celebrating together all the birthdays or anniversaries or other special events that occurred during that month. " )
( HAW-252-02 "But during these past few years, these celebrations have become subdued since both Claire and Bert have been suffering from worsening heart problems. " )
( HAW-253-00 "Bert has had episodes of heart stoppages that had to be treated with timely application of a defibrillator. " )
( HAW-253-01 "He has already undergone angiogram and angioplasty procedures; and, so far, the doctors are trying to treat him with different medications before resorting to bypass surgery. " )
( HAW-253-02 "Claire has had two cardiac surgeries, attempting to replace a leaking heart valve. " )
( HAW-253-03 "The operations have not been completely successful, and the doctors are reluctant to risk further surgery because of her present condition. " )
( HAW-255-00 "Claire confides, out of his earshot, that his cooking is terrible, and also that for someone with such mechanical aptitude for machinery, he seems to have surprising difficulty with the buttons on the dishwasher or washing machine! " )
( HAW-255-01 "But to him, she always expresses appreciation for whatever he does, even when they both know it was not necessarily done well. " )
( HAW-256-01 "Mostly, they try to take care of whatever they can at home, rest a lot, watch television, and still argue about politics. " )
( HAW-257-00 "Fortunately, so far, their individual episodes of acute weakness or pain have not occurred at the same time. " )
( HAW-257-01 "They seem to take turns being ill, so they also take turns taking care of each other when that happens. " )
( HAW-258-00 "Claire says that she is the most grateful not so much for what Bert does or tries to do, but just for the fact that he is there. " )
( HAW-258-01 "And Bert agrees, saying that it's bad enough being sick, but at least they're not sick alone. " )
( HAW-259-00 "Merle and Jim have been married forty-eight years. " )
( HAW-259-01 "He was in the professional military, serving in the Korean and Vietnam Wars and then, in his peacetime service, doing mainly administrative work in public relations and personnel. " )
( HAW-259-02 "Merle traveled around with him, and their little son, trying to set up home and family life wherever they were for however long they were there. " )
( HAW-259-03 "She laughingly describes herself as a camp follower. " )
( HAW-260-01 "Merle knew that she had to be flexible and independent. " )
( HAW-260-02 "She had to be ready and able to make quick decisions and take quick action, and often she had to be able to take action by herself because Jim was on assignment elsewhere. " )
( HAW-260-03 "And Jim knew that he had to have, and did have, complete confidence that Merle could handle things by herself: household tasks, moving arrangements, their son's education, family health needs without his having to worry about them. " )
( HAW-261-00 "After he retired from the military, Jim took a job for a few years in civilian newspaper work, and Merle had the opportunity finally to set up a permanent home. " )
( HAW-261-01 "Things continued this way until Jim suffered a stroke and had to retire fully. " )
( HAW-261-02 "By this time, their son had grown up, and grown somewhat apart from them. " )
( HAW-261-03 "Their relationship is cordial but not close, and they are disappointed about this, Merle more than Jim, and wonder why it happened. " )
( HAW-261-04 "Jim suggests that perhaps because of his military duty, he was not available enough as a father. " )
( HAW-261-05 "Merle suggests that because of their nomadic lifestyle, they could not provide a stable environment. " )
( HAW-261-06 "They try not to be obsessed with or depressed about it. " )
( HAW-261-07 "Yet Merle says it would be nice if their son were closer to them especially these past few years. " )
( HAW-261-08 "But Jim shrugs, it's his decision, and his problem. " )
( HAW-262-00 "About four years ago, Jim suffered a major stroke that required months of hospitalization and rehabilitation at various veterans facilities. " )
( HAW-262-01 "He was paralyzed on one side, and his speech was also affected but never his mind, as he is quick to point out. " )
( HAW-262-02 "He went through months of physical and speech therapy, fighting his way back to normal speech, and even improved use of his right arm and leg. " )
( HAW-262-03 "He has to use a cane when he walks, he uses a computer instead of writing by hand, and he can drive with special equipment in his car. " )
( HAW-263-00 "Merle never cried over his stroke or allowed him to cry, and she never babied or pitied him during his recovery. " )
( HAW-263-01 "She asked him to do things for himself, and encouraged him to try to do things that were difficult or frustrating or even exhausting. " )
( HAW-263-03 "Pretend you're still in the army, and I'm the commanding officer! " )
( HAW-265-00 "Just as Merle didn't baby Jim after his stroke, he doesn't indulge in pity or sentimentality over her condition either. " )
( HAW-265-01 "And now that he is sufficiently recovered from his stroke, he is trying to encourage and push her to do more. " )
( HAW-265-02 "The two of them have always had a kind of gruff teasing relationship with each other, which masks the affection underneath. " )
( HAW-265-03 "They even poke fun at each other about their health problems and weaknesses; she sometimes calls him Gimpy, and he calls her Wheezy. " )
( HAW-265-04 "People who meet them for the first time are often taken aback by this rough teasing and seeming insensitivity. " )
( HAW-265-05 "Merle and Jim are aware of people's surprise, even shock, at their remarks. " )
( HAW-265-06 "They try to explain by saying, We're just a couple of tough old birds! " )
( HAW-266-00 "When Connie and Mark were married, almost fifty years ago, her mother was worried that her daughter would be burdened with a sick husband because Mark had already been diagnosed with diabetes. " )
( HAW-266-01 "But he made little of this illness, and for many years experienced few and rare effects. " )
( HAW-266-02 "Most of the time, he simply ignored the diagnosis, ignored doctor's advice, ignored recommended medications and diet, and insisted that he could take care of himself. " )
( HAW-266-03 "At first, Connie tried to influence, even nag him about taking care of himself, but then she stopped trying, though she never stopped worrying. " )
( HAW-267-00 "Connie acknowledges that during the early years of their marriage, they quarreled a lot, partly, she admits, because she was oversensitive and she overreacted sometimes. " )
( HAW-268-00 "On the other hand, Mark also accepts responsibility, describing himself as a stubborn, uncompromising, and fiercely independent curmudgeon. " )
( HAW-268-02 "As a result, he has never liked being told what to do. " )
( HAW-268-03 "So for him, diabetic restrictions felt like attempts to control his life, which he has always resented and resisted. " )
( HAW-269-00 "They have two daughters. " )
( HAW-269-01 "The older daughter is more accommodating, like her mother, and the younger one is more strong-willed, like her father. " )
( HAW-269-02 "Indeed, in times of family disagreements, each daughter tends to ally herself with the parent she more closely resembles. " )
( HAW-271-04 "She returned home, but her walking is slow, still painful, and there is a noticeable residual limp. " )
( HAW-272-02 "The doctors have also warned her that she may now be vulnerable to further falls, accidents, or injuries. " )
( HAW-273-00 "Connie worries about how long her recovery will take, and whether there will ever be complete recovery. " )
( HAW-273-03 "Yet she's not really reassured, and she explains that the best way he can help her is to really take care of himself. " )
( HAW-275-00 "Lois and Walt are both slim, well-groomed, well spoken, and look younger than their age. " )
( HAW-279-02 "This has caused a minor problem with their little grandchildren, who no longer enjoy visiting because there are no goodies to eat! " )
( HAW-281-02 "So whenever Walt or other members of the family complain or criticize, she tells them, you'll see. " )
( HAW-281-03 "Someday you'll thank me for it! " )
( HAW-283-00 "Neither Sally nor Gene suffers from anything more than minor health problems that, for the most part, they are able to ignore. " )
( HAW-285-03 "They both wanted to make more frequent trips to visit their son and daughter in different parts of the state. " )
( HAW-285-05 "And finally, they wanted to travel afar, which they could never afford before but had always dreamed about. " )
( HAW-286-03 "Now it's just the opposite. " )
( HAW-290-05 "She says the time will come when she might not be able to do these kinds of things, and she doesn't want to regret missed chances. " )
( HAW-293-01 "When Frances asked Jay directly, Are you saying you want to just go on working and wait till you have to be carried out? " )

( HAW-366-03 "Interestingly, these parents are beginning to have some mixed feelings about their children's roles, or nonroles, in caretaking. " )
( HAW-370-00 "First, there is the couple's shared history of love, experience, and mutual concern through all the years. " )
( HAW-371-00 "There are also two related factors that are neither selfless nor selfish, but realistic. " )
( HAW-373-03 "Or sometimes it is simply a consequence or continuation of lifelong habits of nurturing. " )
( HAW-375-01 "At this stage of life, even a limited, painful, difficult relationship may be better than no relationship at all. " )

( HAW-378-03 "And they know that no matter how much or how well they do it, eventually and inevitably it will not be enough. " )
( HAW-381-01 "True, they now spend much more time with each other, although sometimes that actually becomes a source of irritation or frustration,. " )

( ITAE-058-05 "I rubbed my hand against my face. " )
( ITAE-071-00 "Girding myself for the effort ahead, I shimmied to the side of the bed. " )
( ITAE-071-03 "I sat up, turned, and put my feet on the floor. " )
( ITAE-071-04 "When I stood up, the bed rocked gently back to its neutral position. " )
( ITAE-072-02 "Given my growing sense of urgency, I figured it was one. " )
( ITAE-077-00 "Standing like attendants around our bed were four large rose-colored urns. " )
( ITAE-077-01 "About three feet high, they tapered gently from the mouth to the base. " )
( ITAE-077-02 "A riot of flowers and herbs issued forth from each, filling the room with the subtle yet distinctive aroma of life and growth. " )
( ITAE-079-00 "The walls, by comparison, were rather plain. " )
( ITAE-079-04 "They enclosed a single room that was quite small, probably no more than sixteen feet square. " )
( ITAE-083-00 "We lay back, tired from the effort of sitting up. " )
( ITAE-083-01 "We could hear voices outside the room. " )
( ITAE-083-04 "There seemed to be the tinkle of wooden wind chimes in the breeze, adding their tones to those of the birds we could hear singing. " )
( ITAE-084-01 "We wondered, but dared not ask each other, who these people were and what they would do with us. " )
( ITAE-085-03 "Together, we leaned forward and, using each other for support, brought ourselves to a standing position. " )
( ITAE-086-02 "This time, she brought a tray loaded with dishes of steaming food and two teapots. " )
( ITAE-086-05 "We wolfed down mouthful after mouthful of the delicious offerings, and when our plates were empty, she refilled them. " )
( ITAE-090-01 "The woman understood our fatigue and gently helped us back to bed. " )
( ITAE-092-00 "Strength is creeping slowly back into our muscles and our spirits. " )
( ITAE-092-02 "The craftsmanship that surrounds us speaks of the generations of artisans who have set their hands to work here. " )
( ITAE-092-08 "I can only imagine their joy when they learn that we are safe. " )
( ITAE-093-02 "We have enjoyed the food and, with her urging, continue to drink her distasteful tea. " )
( ITAE-094-01 "We told her about Montserrat's vengeful volcano. " )
( ITAE-094-02 "She shuddered visibly as we gave our account of being sucked from the ship's broken hull. " )
( ITAE-095-04 "I came here just as you did, but a very long time ago. " )
( ITAE-097-07 "I, like you, came here from the Other World. " )
( ITAE-102-01 "I jabbed my finger toward her face. " )
( ITAE-104-05 "If you value your life, you will take us to the United States embassy and you will take us there now! " )
( ITAE-113-02 "The green is perhaps a hundred yards long and, at its widest point, maybe fifty yards across. " )
( ITAE-115-00 "Hannah then put her arms around our waists and whispered that we should walk with her to the center of the green. " )
( ITAE-115-07 "Words of welcome, which we did not understand, followed quickly. " )
( ITAE-115-08 "Children, who had hidden behind their mothers, peeked out at us. " )
( ITAE-119-01 "With simple gestures and nods, they invited us to eat our first meal in their company. " )
( ITAE-122-01 "In fact, so far, I have found no reason to doubt Hannah's assertion that we are stranded here forever. " )
( ITAE-125-02 "Far to the south and east, are the Pal-chin mountains. " )
( ITAE-127-06 "We, at least, have each other. " )
( ITAE-131-01 "We stepped onto the porch, knocked on her door, and were greeted with a smile as Hannah swung the door open. " )
( ITAE-133-01 "After a long moment, she shook her head and lifted her gaze, ready for a new topic. " )
( ITAE-133-03 "She taught me the names of all the herbs and flowers that grow in our forests and meadows. " )
( ITAE-137-04 "Haleigh tends the village garden and did so even before Hannah's arrival. " )
( ITAE-144-01 "You seem to understand so many little things but none of the big things. " )
( ITAE-147-01 "Our minds raced through the research we had read. " )
( ITAE-159-01 "What are they for? " )
( ITAE-161-01 "We had always taken the presence of older adults for granted. " )
( ITAE-161-02 "It was all about demographics, populations curves, birth, longevity and death rates interacting over time. " )
( ITAE-164-00 "We considered Hannah's words carefully. " )
( ITAE-167-00 "Hannah chose her words carefully. " )
( ITAE-181-03 "Once inside our cottage, I lit a candle and pulled out my journal. " )
( ITAE-182 "I slammed my journal down on the bench. " )
( ITAE-189-02 "The sound of my name carried easily across the crisp air of the autumn afternoon. " )
( ITAE-190-01 "I closed my eyes and, for the thousandth time, relived the shipwreck. " )
( ITAE-190-03 "My body has healed, but the gash this experience has torn in my life remains an open wound. " )
( ITAE-192-00 "We have mastered perhaps a half dozen phrases of the people's language, so we can now exchange pleasantries with those we meet. " )
( ITAE-192-03 "Everything we have seen and heard tells us that these are kind-hearted people who reckon time in moons and seasons rather than days. " )
( ITAE-210-00 "Lost in her own thoughts, Jude didn't answer. " )
( ITAE-213-00 "The role of children remains somewhat puzzling. " )
( ITAE-213-02 "We naturally think of childhood as a time in which the young are shielded from the rough and tumble of adult life. " )
( ITAE-213-05 "The young play, work, laugh, learn, and sing along with the rest of the people. " )
( ITAE-221-03 "You've been here for so long that you've lost your sense of perspective. " )
( ITAE-222-02 "This village has barely made it out of the stone age, and everything about this place is dull and stunted. " )
( ITAE-222-03 "At home, I have thousands of life-saving drugs at my disposal; you have to make do with thousands of roots and leaves. " )
( ITAE-222-06 "With that, Jude grabbed my arm and shot me a look that said, stop. " )
( ITAE-225-05 "Though they are often tempted to forget it, human beings are much like these flowers. " )
( ITAE-230-00 "Eager to make up for my earlier harsh words, I jumped right in. " )
( ITAE-237-01 "All I could think was that I had graduated from Harvard, and these people saw me as a potential goatherd. " )
( ITAE-238-01 "My dear, Haleigh needs an extra pair of hands in the village garden, and we think you would do quite well there. " )
( ITAE-242-03 "I'm not sure I understand it enough to put it into words just now. " )
( ITAE-243-03 "I have become the people's goatherd and, for the first time in my life, I know contentment. " )
( ITAE-244-02 "Given my earlier outbursts on the backwardness of Kallimos, I was sure this was her revenge. " )
( ITAE-244-05 "Her loving counsel finally convinced me to stow my paranoia and assume the role assigned to me. " )
( ITAE-245-00 "Was there ever a recruit more raw? " )
( ITAE-246-02 "A watchful eye is necessary, she said, to ensure that they all return safely to the barn. " )
( ITAE-246-08 "Once the barn is reached, he whistles for the children and elders who assist with the milking. " )
( ITAE-251-01 "Trust me this once. " )
( ITAE-252-04 "There were Hildy and Martha, who always seemed to forget where they were and wandered near the edge of a gorge. " )
( ITAE-252-06 "There was Susie, who would nudge and nuzzle me when I sat down for lunch. " )
( ITAE-252-08 "I pointed out how their coats glowed, and I bragged about their milk production. " )
( ITAE-256-01 "So am I, but I think that the path has grown steeper since the last time I climbed it. " )
( ITAE-257-04 "Which is more beautiful, earth or sky? " )
( ITAE-258-01 "I really understand how much pain loneliness can cause. " )
( ITAE-268-02 "Without relationships, there can be no companionship. " )
( ITAE-272-00 "Hannah agreed but, as usual, phrased the thought in a more elegant way. " )
( ITAE-278-03 "They had wandered near the edge of the gorge. " )
( ITAE-278-05 "When I returned, Hannah looked at me sadly. " )
( ITAE-281-01 "I watched her as she disappeared down the footpath. " )
( ITAE-281-02 "Then I returned to my goats. " )
( ITAE-289-01 "She grabbed my hands and turned them palm up. " )
( ITAE-295-00 "Within five minutes of our initial meeting, Haleigh had marched me to the bean patch and set me to work weeding. " )
( ITAE-297-03 "Her laughter was as full-bodied and rich as her fury. " )
( ITAE-297-04 "The guffaw seemed to rise from her toes. " )
( ITAE-297-05 "Her body rocked with gales of laughter, and tears came to her eyes. " )
( ITAE-297-07 "She led me to her cottage and, recognizing how tired I was, made a place for me to lie down. " )
( ITAE-301-00 "She busied herself making tea and then invited me to sit on the porch with her. " )
( ITAE-303-06 "When you watch the tasks being done from the shady comfort of your front porch, they look easy enough. " )
( ITAE-304-01 "The work varies but the routine is constant, because it's no fun to get behind and have to be out in the midday sun. " )
( ITAE-305-00 "Haleigh insists that neither plants nor people should be fooled with during the heat of the day. " )
( ITAE-305-05 "That's because I am with Haleigh all day long and he is with his goats. " )
( ITAE-306-02 "There may be no supporting research to back it up, but with results like hers, who cares? " )
( ITAE-308-00 "This is my first chance to get back to my journal since Jude's entry. " )
( ITAE-308-07 "These are hard times. " )
( ITAE-314-00 "I did so but kept my eye on Haleigh; the hotter it got, the further she drooped. " )
( ITAE-320-02 "I was here tending this garden before your grandparents were born. " )
( ITAE-320-06 "You might as well tear out my heart as ask me to leave it when it needs me. " )
( ITAE-322-03 "Is that what you want? " )
( ITAE-323-02 "She took them and, sputtering and grumbling, trudged away from me. " )
( ITAE-324-01 "She spoke to me in the soft, mocking, singsong voice that every child knows. " )
( ITAE-342-08 "It was Jude. " )
( ITAE-345-00 "Haleigh rocked gently back and forth in the woven chair that hung from the porch ceiling. " )
( ITAE-345-01 "She took a sip from the brown mug she cradled in her hands and began her story. " )
( ITAE-346-03 "The Moon was the elder of the sisters, and like the hair of the Elders of the People, she shone with the dazzling brilliance of silver. " )
( ITAE-347-04 "Their tears filled the seas, the lakes, and the rivers. " )
( ITAE-347-05 "Even to this day, the Sun mourns the Earth's grim fate. " )
( ITAE-347-06 "The tears she sheds make the rain that falls upon our heads. " )
( ITAE-348-04 "Together, they held the darkness at bay. " )
( ITAE-350-03 "My light is silver, yours is gold, but the love I feel for our dear sister gives me strength. " )
( ITAE-350-05 "Those brave words failed to reassure the Sun, and her anxiety grew with the passing of the ages. " )
( ITAE-350-08 "The Moon quenched her fires, and darkness fell for the first time upon the face of the Earth. " )
( ITAE-351-03 "Still, she endured. " )
( ITAE-352-01 "The Sun called to her once, but she did not answer. " )
( ITAE-353-05 "Despite the Sun's desperate pleas, the Moon fell silent and was never heard from again. " )
( ITAE-353-07 "The Sun is recalling this great disgrace. " )
( ITAE-354-01 "During the day, she pours her light and heat down upon her little sister, the Earth. " )
( ITAE-357-04 "I decided to stop at the barn to check the goats water, so Jude headed home alone. " )
( ITAE-364-00 "I'm staying at the barn tonight. " )
( ITAE-364-03 "Looking out the window, I watched her as she approached the barn, accompanied only by her silent moon shadow. " )
( ITAE-364-09 "Then we sat side by side on the floor of the barn and talked. " )
( ITAE-365-03 "We struggled to understand how something that had seemed so bright, smart, and true could now seem so terribly wrong. " )
( ITAE-375-02 "Everyone else was willing to let her decide what she needed. " )
( ITAE-382-05 "Now I saw that I was alone in expecting her to surrender her freedom. " )
( ITAE-383-01 "People there have far too little understanding of the ways that giving care can bring strength and satisfaction into one's life. " )
( ITAE-383-05 "Like everything else in this world, these things can be done well or poorly. " )
( ITAE-384-00 "I, making a promise to myself, that I will be more diligent in my journal keeping. " )
( ITAE-385-02 "For the first time since our arrival in Kallimos, however, our day was followed by a long, strange, exhilarating night. " )
( ITAE-386-01 "The morning was cool with a gentle, northerly breeze. " )
( ITAE-386-04 "We ate a light meal, sat on the porch, and visited with the neighbors. " )
( ITAE-390-00 "By this time, a commotion outside our door had replaced the usual late evening calm. " )
( ITAE-394-03 "Men, women, and children, all on their hands and knees, huddled inside the torches shimmering pools of light. " )
( ITAE-394-04 "With their bare hands, they were carefully opening freshly turned mounds of sand. " )
( ITAE-397-00 "She put her hands on her hips and looked like she was about to explode, but then hesitated. " )
( ITAE-397-04 "The wise take only one egg from each nest, and always choose the smallest of those they find. " )
( ITAE-397-05 "The stories say that the turtles have been coming since long before our ancestors became part of this world. " )
( ITAE-400-02 "The gray light that comes before the dawn had just broken over the mountains when we returned to the village and our beds. " )
( ITAE-401-01 "The first night, everyone was tired and went to bed early. " )
( ITAE-403-02 "Sure, we were injured and exhausted when we first arrived on Kallimos, but other than that, why wouldn't she be proud of us? " )
( ITAE-411-00 "I looked at Jude. " )
( ITAE-411-02 "If we had washed up on a shore far from the village, we would have died of anger and fear, not hunger and thirst. " )
( ITAE-414-00 "The lives Jude and I lead here are as heavily spiced as the food we eat. " )
( ITAE-414-01 "The rigid, controlled existence we knew is slipping away, and we are glad to let it go. " )
( ITAE-414-04 "In the Other World, I listened to recordings of professional musicians and felt ashamed at my lack of talent. " )
( ITAE-415-06 "Instead, the night and the days that followed were infused with the spirit of life, love, and laughter. " )
( ITAE-415-07 "Jude and I dug turtle nests with an old woman and a young boy, and we were glad for their company. " )
( ITAE-416-02 "They have given us milk through the spring and summer, but now this is their time. " )
( ITAE-416-03 "They will spend the winter in the barn, give birth in the spring, and again treat us to their milk. " )
( ITAE-416-04 "So it goes, round and round. " )
( ITAE-417-00 "I miss Bill, and somehow recording the day's events in his journal makes him seem closer. " )
( ITAE-417-03 "Mostly, we talk about little things. " )
( ITAE-421-04 "She noticed that I was missing from the circle and searched for me with her eyes. " )
( ITAE-425-05 "What did he eat? " )
( ITAE-427-01 "His name was Samuel. " )
( ITAE-427-03 "While others sought Caleb to find the solution to a problem, Samuel wished to become Caleb's student. " )
( ITAE-427-05 "He wanted to learn his secrets, his truths, and his wisdom. " )
( ITAE-431-01 "This sudden departure surprised Samuel. " )
( ITAE-431-04 "Samuel took one last look at his belongings, shrugged his shoulders, and started down the path in pursuit of Caleb. " )
( ITAE-432-05 "Days and sometimes weeks would go by without a single word passing from Caleb's lips. " )
( ITAE-432-08 "They whetted his appetite for knowledge and wisdom. " )
( ITAE-433-05 "What is he waiting for? " )
( ITAE-434-03 "I have been gentle and patient, but now my heart is full of anger. " )
( ITAE-441-00 "The question again puzzled Samuel. " )
( ITAE-445-01 "Yes, now the basket is full! " )
( ITAE-447-03 "Samuel started to interrupt, but Caleb would not allow it. " )
( ITAE-449-02 "I am sorry. " )
( ITAE-453-00 "On my way home from the garden, I took a path that wound through the village and the forest. " )
( ITAE-455-02 "When human beings have enough food to lose their fear of hunger, they divide into two camps. " )
( ITAE-455-04 "In the Other World, Bill and I had enough food, or great events, in our lives. " )
( ITAE-455-08 "We could just as easily have filled them with drugs, alcohol, television, gambling, exercise, or shopping, as others have. " )
( ITAE-456-01 "People there have lost touch with joy. " )
( ITAE-456-03 "We settle for counterfeits, fakes, because they are quickly purchased and briefly filling. " )
( ITAE-459-01 "It made the shipwreck seem like a swim in a pond. " )
( ITAE-460-03 "I was more than halfway back to the barn in the late afternoon when I heard a child calling to me. " )
( ITAE-468-01 "A hand touched my arm gently. " )
( ITAE-473-05 "I continued my pleadings, albeit at a lower volume. " )
( ITAE-473-08 "Spare nothing. " )
( ITAE-474-02 "This is one of those times. " )
( ITAE-479-01 "I made a raft of far-reaching promises and improbable bargains. " )
( ITAE-481-00 "With that simple permission, I poured out my soul to Jude. " )
( ITAE-483-01 "My heart leapt into my throat. " )
( ITAE-483-09 "They filled the room with their perfume. " )
( ITAE-483-13 "Jude's eyelids fluttered and then opened. " )
( ITAE-486-00 "I felt Jude squeeze my hand softly, once then twice. " )
( ITAE-487-01 "Haleigh, Hannah, and I took turns nursing her. " )
( ITAE-488-02 "You have told me that you spent many years studying to be a physician. " )

( ITAE-583-00 "As far as I was concerned, Haleigh had just opened the doors to paradise. " )
( ITAE-584-01 "Her name was Rachael, and she lived in a little village in the northwest corner of Kallimos. " )

( ITAE-592-02 "She asked, hoping that she had somehow misunderstood the words. " )
( ITAE-597-07 "Not daring to breathe, she pulled on it sharply. " )
( ITAE-598-03 "She tied the pouch to a string, and placed the string around her neck. " )
( ITAE-598-07 "Are you there? " )
( ITAE-603-02 "In the darkness that surrounded her, she could hear the leaves on the trees rustle and an owl hooting deep in the forest. " )
( ITAE-607-03 "Tell me, child, what did you learn? " )
( ITAE-608-01 "Before that story, I did not understand the relationship between patience and courage. " )
( ITAE-613-01 "My dear child, you begin right now, right here, in this moment. " )
( ITAE-614-01 "I will begin now, in this darkness, lying on this ground. " )
( ITAE-617-00 "The smoke curled into the darkness above the dying embers. " )
( ITAE-618-00 "Each day of our journey and stay in Shah-pan, it seems to me now, has been filled with wonder. " )
( ITAE-619-02 "They roused Jude and me from a deep sleep and insisted that we needed to talk. " )
( ITAE-620-01 "William. " )
( ITAE-620-02 "Jude. " )
( ITAE-633-00 "Playing host to our uninvited guests seemed to calm Jude. " )
( ITAE-638-00 "Jude's natural optimism presented itself. " )
( ITAE-638-03 "If Bill and I stay away from the shore, we have nothing to fear. " )
( ITAE-638-04 "From now on, neither of us is going anywhere near the beach, not even for turtle eggs. " )
( ITAE-642-00 "Hannah opened her mouth to answer my challenge and then seemed to think better of it. " )
( ITAE-642-04 "We'll be going now. " )
( ITAE-643-00 "We walked them to the door and bid our farewells there. " )
( ITAE-643-05 "Soon, too soon, we will mourn their passing from this world. " )
( ITAE-643-08 "It will serve them well in the Other World. " )
( ITAE-645-00 "The weather has been fantastic. " )
( ITAE-645-02 "No storm clouds on the horizon, and neither Haleigh nor Hannah has spoken of omens or signs. " )
( ITAE-654-02 "I didn't want to admit to eavesdropping on our guest's conversation, and I didn't want to alarm Jude. " )
( ITAE-655-01 "We laughed, told stories, and sang songs. " )
( ITAE-655-02 "And then Hannah brought out her sweet, hot, after-dinner tea, and we settled into our chairs. " )
( ITAE-657-00 "Still, for all of its beauty, Neekells had poor soil, and its air was thin and cold. " )
( ITAE-658-01 "Wind, rain, and hail flattened the crops and tore the roof off the town hall. " )
( ITAE-658-09 "Seizing a sledgehammer, one of the men split the stone open. " )
( ITAE-660-03 "The bleak winter would not starve them after all. " )
( ITAE-665-00 "Bruised and battered, Bruno pulled himself up and charged the old man in a blood red fury. " )
( ITAE-666-01 "Now what would they do? " )
( ITAE-666-02 "They mumbled and frowned, they argued and discussed, until finally one voice rang out. " )
( ITAE-666-04 "Lucinda can talk the bark off a tree. " )
( ITAE-667-06 "The hermit looked up, and she continued. " )
( ITAE-669-02 "I hear a stream down below, but I'm so tired from my climb. " )
( ITAE-690-00 "With the treasure in hand, The People of Neekells bought the food they needed for winter. " )
( ITAE-691-01 "I looked up and saw tears rimming her eyes. " )
( ITAE-691-06 "Soon life will ask you to fight the three plagues in the Other World, of that I am sure. " )
( ITAE-705-00 "Jude understood Hannah's point. " )
( ITAE-714-02 "There is no substitute for wise leadership, the lifeblood of any struggle against the three plagues. " )
( ITAE-716-05 "This is the last page in my journal. " )
( ITAE-717-00 "The wind blew hard that night when I finished my journal and crawled into bed. " )
( ITAE-717-03 "I remember how they rattled against their latches with an eerie, unsettled rhythm. " )
( ITAE-718-00 "After we finished, I dashed for the barn. " )
( ITAE-718-01 "The goats welcomed me and seemed reassured by my presence in the midst of the storm. " )
( ITAE-718-09 "I closed the door to the barn and dashed home through the wind and pelting rain. " )
( ITAE-721-00 "The wind and rain pounded the sturdy walls of our home as we traded stories and jokes, as we sang and laughed. " )
( ITAE-722-08 "You would honor The People if you would tell their stories and teach others the lessons you have learned here. " )
( ITAE-723-00 "She turned to face Jude. " )
( ITAE-723-01 "My tears choked me until I let them go. " )
( ITAE-724-04 "You understood it, and it understood you. " )
( ITAE-728-00 "I watched Jude, knowing that she shared my fear. " )
( ITAE-729-01 "He was drenched to the skin, and his face was white with terror. " )
( ITAE-735-00 "With that, she broke free from my grasp and disappeared into the storm. " )
( ITAE-736-05 "Unable to call for help above the roaring wind and unwilling to risk the surf that surrounded him, he sat there terrified. " )
( ITAE-737-01 "Jude reached it first and pulled herself up its slippery sides. " )
( ITAE-737-08 "Still, the storm surge was rising, and we needed to move. " )
( ITAE-738-01 "Twice the waves hurled us into the grasp of the waiting rescuers. " )
( ITAE-739-01 "I looked up into the narrowed, suspicious eyes of a Montserrat policeman. " )
( ITAE-744-00 "I started to tell him about the rumblings we thought were the volcano and the way our boat had been torn apart. " )
( ITAE-747-00 "Call from a Montserrat police station. " )
( ITAE-748-00 "Dad confirmed our identities, which seemed to reassure the detective. " )
( ITAE-748-01 "Dad also promised to wire us money and make arrangements for a flight back to the United States in the morning. " )
( ITAE-749-01 "From an alley came the sound of children crying in frightened, screeching voices. " )
( ITAE-750-00 "I will remember the reunion with our families for the rest of my life. " )
( ITAE-750-01 "They met us at the Syracuse airport, and our homecoming was so emotional that even strangers at the gate got choked up. " )
( ITAE-757-01 "Being back has been hard for both of us, and I think Jude realized that I needed some kind of release. " )
( ITAE-758-00 "A hedgerow that should offer some protection against the winter's north wind. " )
( ITAE-762-02 "I've sketched out plans for a barn that will be smaller, but just as serviceable as the one on Kallimos. " )
( ITAE-762-03 "This project is going to stretch us to the limit, but I think we can get the house closed in and the barn up before snow flies. " )
( ITAE-765-02 "Actually, I think Jude's mom and dad see this as a hopeful sign that we're not totally crazy. " )
( ITAE-766-01 "We can boast of a complete set of doors and windows. " )
( ITAE-766-02 "The interior is nowhere near finished, but we can do most of the work during the winter. " )
( ITAE-767-00 "Jude's garden is in full bloom. " )
( ITAE-769-00 "Our first goats arrived today. " )
( ITAE-770-00 "Our folks may doubt our stories about Kallimos, but they are impressed with Jude's way with a garden. " )
( ITAE-770-01 "The harvest is going to be huge, even though this is the first season the plot has been tilled. " )
( ITAE-771-00 "Jude's pregnancy is really showing now. " )
( ITAE-773-05 "I feel confused and overwhelmed by this new responsibility, but I know one thing for certain, our little girl is beautiful. " )
( ITAE-774-02 "If everyone knows the song, then everyone can comfort the baby. " )
( ITAE-783-01 "Jude, Haleigh, and I are spending the evening huddled beside our wood stove. " )
( ITAE-784-03 "There is no moon tonight, so I am making my way to and from the barn by the light of my kerosene lantern. " )
( ITAE-788-03 "I used to think that we switched to English because we were being lazy. " )
( ITAE-789-02 "What we do not have, however, is that wonderful sense of belonging, that sense of being embraced, that we had there. " )
( ITAE-790-01 "They ooh and ah over the neatly stacked cords of firewood, the well-stocked root cellar, and the pungent goat cheese. " )
( ITAE-796-00 "I opened my eyes, and there was Hannah, by the side of our bed. " )
( ITAE-796-01 "She asked me to join her for tea, so I followed her to the kitchen. " )
( ITAE-797-00 "I told her about our return to this world, our visit to Montserrat's jail, and our reunion with our families. " )
( ITAE-798-05 "I reached out and touched her, and I could feel her warmth. " )
( ITAE-808-06 "It's just, it's the way it is. " )
( ITAE-809 "Medicine that could cure cancer, would you share your knowledge of that remedy with the world? " )
( ITAE-814-03 "I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. " )
( ITAE-814-04 "The clock ticked behind us as I sat silent, torn between grief at what we had lost and guilt for what I had not done. " )
( ITAE-816-02 "Good fortune had blessed the inhabitants of this land with a series of wise and gentle kings. " )
( ITAE-819-03 "Will he be wise or foolish? " )
( ITAE-820-01 "He showed little interest in the heroic exploits of the mountain traders, and he was slow to learn the songs that were sung of their deeds. " )
( ITAE-821-02 "Years passed, and in time, Sarop became king. " )
( ITAE-823-03 "From Tiga in the north to Ogewo in the south, all must hear my words. " )
( ITAE-825-04 "Curls of shaved wood peaked out from the cuffs of his patched trousers. " )
( ITAE-827-02 "He and his guests laughed at the foolish young king until their sides ached. " )
( ITAE-828-02 "We'll build one vessel, and then everyone will want one. " )
( ITAE-830-04 "The cooper stood nervously in front of his work, a giant barrel that was split lengthwise down the middle and laid on its side. " )
( ITAE-831-03 "The crowd of courtiers fell silent as the families were marched at spear point to the waiting vessels. " )
( ITAE-834-02 "On the beach, cold and gray as the sea itself, lay the bodies of the patriarch, his wife, and their children. " )
( ITAE-835-02 "The king ordered that ropes be thrown to them, and the unfortunate souls were hauled to shore. " )
( ITAE-836-02 "As soon as the boat was secured, the king made his way to its side. " )
( ITAE-837-04 "Now rise, sir, rise and begin your work. " )
( ITAE-842-00 "I told Jude about Hannah's visit in the morning, and we have talked about little else since. " )

( ITAE-859-09 "Yesterday, I went to see a dying patient and found the remains of last night's supper covering his sheets. " )
( ITAE-859-11 "For God's sake, this is a human being. " )
( ITAE-859-12 "Today, I went on rounds, and we identified three new stage-four pressure ulcers. " )
( ITAE-860-00 "The response to my protests? " )
( ITAE-860-05 "Walking the halls is like entering one of the inner circles of hell. " )
( ITAE-863-00 "Three days ago, federal surveyors arrived for a surprise inspection. " )

( ITAE-877-02 "His face was lined deeply by decades of exposure to the sun and wind, and his jacket could not hide his enormous forearms. " )
( ITAE-883-00 "I slouched down into the seat while the old man mashed on the clutch, shoved the car into gear, and jerked the car into motion. " )
( ITAE-883-01 "As the sleeves of his too small jacket slid up his arms, I could see muddy blue blotches that must have been ancient tattoos. " )
( ITAE-886-01 "Look, son, quit complaining, and remember that this is a broken world. " )
( ITAE-888 "He smiled slightly as he peered through the rain on the windshield. " )
( ITAE-905-03 "I raced inside, but by the time Jude and I made it back to the porch, the car and its mysterious driver were gone. " )
( ITAE-906-04 "The way ahead is hard, but the day will come when many will share the work of the Eden Alternative with you. " )

( ITAE-911-04 "My heart broke that day, and it has never really been the same since. " )
( ITAE-911-05 "I was thinking of that when I wrote the following lines: " )
( ITAE-913-00 "We took Haleigh to the best pediatric neurologists in the world. " )
( ITAE-915-06 "Thank you, Jude. " )

( ITAE-943-00 "What are old people for? " )
( ITAE-943-03 "The value of elderhood, its unique capacity to serve the needs of people of all ages, is in danger of being lost. " )
( ITAE-943-05 "Our culture declares that adulthood is forever, that old age is decline, that perfection is lodged in youth and youth alone. " )
( ITAE-947-02 "While all of these transitions are precious, and potentially beautiful, the last has, more than we know, enriched all the others. " )
( ITAE-952-07 "Over time, they lost contact. " )

( ITAE-961-04 "For their part, they could have become wise men, the elders of this community. " )

( ITAE-962-05 "They are also far more durable. " )
( ITAE-963-01 "Storytelling is one of the pleasures of life, its sweetness enhanced when the story is used to transmit a bit of wisdom. " )

( NAN_001 "The reasons, I believe, are twofold. " )
( NAN_002 "First, rapid societal changes have complicated parents' task, making child rearing more challenging than in previous generations. " )
( NAN_003 "Second, information about child development disseminated to parents is increasingly voluminous, but at the same time contradictory. " )
( NAN_004 "Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules, much like a business appointment. " )
( NAN_005 "They love their children, but they also love and need their work, for personal and financial reasons. " )
( NAN_006 "Hence they find themselves in a juggling act between the two, with work usually winning out. " )
( NAN_007 "In these investigations, some parents exchanged positive emotional signals with and verbally stimulated their infants, and read to and conversed with their preschoolers. " )
( NAN_008 "Other parents spent time with their children, but were not actively engaged with them. " )
( NAN_009 "These findings are not an indictment of maternal employment or nonparental child care. " )
( NAN_010 "Rather, they underscore the importance of considering the needs of children when making work and childcare decisions. " )
( NAN_011 "Employed mothers of cognitively competent, well-adjusted children value their parenting role, and succeed at coordinating it with job responsibilities. " )
( NAN_012 "Such mothers schedule regular times to devote to their children, and combine warmth with consistent expectations for mature behavior. " )
( NAN_013 "In sum, increasingly pressured adult lives have contributed to parental difficulties in granting children the attention they need. " )
( NAN_014 "When employed parents spend generous amounts of time engaged with their child, they safeguard the child's development. " )
( NAN_015 "Under these conditions, children often reap extra benefits from more equitable involvement of both parents. " )
( NAN_016 "Piaget's contribution to the field of child development is enormous. " )
( NAN_017 "He inspired more research on children's thinking than any other single theorist. " )
( NAN_018 "Damon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance, nor the tumultuous reign of the child. " )
( NAN_019 "Instead, he underscores that children are avid, active learners, but adults must cultivate their drive toward mastery. " )
( NAN_020 "If free time is so abundant, why do so many parents say their lives are pressure cookers? " )
( NAN_021 "The reason, Rominson and Godbey suggest, is that our pace of life is faster. " )
( NAN_022 "People expect to do more, to live more intensely. " )
( NAN_023 "Appropriate stimulation wires the brain, prompting it to form new connections and its regions to specialize. " )
( NAN_024 "As this process goes forward, the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation. " )
( NAN_025 "This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures, and ever more advanced knowledge and skills. " )
( NAN_026 "Larry scores high on the temperamental dimension of fearful distress. " )
( NAN_027 "On observing him, most of us would call him a very shy, inhibited child. " )
( NAN_028 "Mitch, in contrast, scores low on fearful distress, and high on positive mood. " )
( NAN_029 "He is, in everyday language, an uninhibited, sociable child. " )
( NAN_030 "Of course, children have an important say in the socialization process. " )
( NAN_031 "For example, they usually become more expert at those skills that complement their native talents. " )
( NAN_032 "American middle-class parents typically regard young children as dependent beings who must be urged toward independence. " )
( NAN_033 "In response to researchers' queries, they frequently say that babies should be trained to be self-reliant from the first few months. " )
( NAN_034 "Consequently, they place a high value on children's learning and doing on their own. " )
( NAN_035 "The image of lovers communicating helps us appreciate the circumstances in which intersubjectivity is most likely to occur: in close relationships. " )
( NAN_036 "Children most often attain it with parents, other family members, teachers, and eventually in friendships with peers. " )
( NAN_037 "Of course, partners in teaching and learning do not need to attain the intersubjective heights of lovers to accomplish their goals. " )
( NAN_038 "Children who are good at detecting others' points of view are better at thinking of effective ways to handle difficult social situations. " )
( NAN_039 "Rather than just asserting their own desires, they try friendly persuasion. " )
( NAN_040 "Or they suggest that a conflict be solved by creating new, mutual goals. " )
( NAN_041 "Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors. " )
( NAN_042 "Because all family members are present, dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity. " )
( NAN_043 "These worrisome findings are not an inherent part of the TV medium. " )
( NAN_044 "Instead, they result from the way it is used in American culture. " )
( NAN_046 "For example, TV content depicting acts of cooperating, helping, and comforting encourages these behaviors in children. " )
( NAN_047 "The Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture. " )
( NAN_048 "Constitutions have come and gone, and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime, including communes, dictatorships, and five distinct republics. " )

( NAN_053 "This was a revolutionary change. " )

( NAN_055 "They were now, in fact, servants of their people. " )
( NAN_056 "Governments existed to guarantee due process, and equal justice for all. " )
( NAN_057 "The local law was no longer simply a creature of the states. " )
( NAN_058 "The states themselves were enmeshed in the law, and subordinate to it. " )
( NAN_059 "My claim is that Lincoln's address expresses the same idea that was then current in Europe. " )
( NAN_060 "Each people of common history and language constitutes a nation, and the natural form for the nation's survival was in a state structure. " )
( NAN_061 "The idea that Americans constituted an organic national unit explained, implicitly, why the eleven Southern states could not go their own way. " )
( NAN_062 "This is not simply a nation of common lineage, an extension of tribal identity. " )
( NAN_063 "We are indeed different from the European nations, for our nation is born of an idea. " )
( NAN_064 "It is conceived in liberty, and dedicated to an aspiration of equality. " )
( NAN_065 "The cornerstone of that case is that governments derive their legitimacy from the consent of their governed. " )

( NAN_075 "However, the fulfillment of one purpose does not guarantee the satisfaction of the others. " )
( NAN_076 "There are homely sturdy buildings, and beautiful flimsy ones. " )
( NAN_077 "A well-planned building can be ugly, just as a beautiful building can function poorly. " )
( NAN_078 "The experience of food is sensual. " )
( NAN_079 "It is also first-hand. " )
( NAN_080 "That is, while it's fun to read recipes and look at photographs of table settings in Gourmet magazine, no one I know considers this a substitute for eating. " )
( NAN_081 "In photographs, buildings are forever young. " )
( NAN_082 "The ravages of time, weather and use are banished. " )
( NAN_083 "It is a shock to come across a revered architectural icon, and to find the concrete stained, the painted window frames chipped, the tiles cracked. " )
( NAN_084 "Although designed at the same time as the Chrysler, the Empire State is quite different in appearance. " )
( NAN_085 "Its exterior is the architectural equivalent of a gray flannel suit. " )
( NAN_086 "There is no decoration. " )
( NAN_087 "The Classical style has proved more durable. " )
( NAN_088 "This has something to do with its remarkable adaptability. " )
( NAN_089 "The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected. " )
( NAN_090 "The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. " )
( NAN_091 "Even Classicism, which appears at first glance to be highly regimented, is not immune. " )
( NAN_092 "If architectural style is a language, an analogy that is deeply flawed, it is closer to slang than to grammatical prose. " )
( NAN_093 "Architectural styles are mutable, unregulated, improvised. " )
( NAN_094 "Architects break the rules, and invent new ones. " )
( NAN_095 "This is not to say that architecture is stage decor. " )
( NAN_096 "When the wind blows, the canvas scenery blows over; the building resists the elements. " )
( NAN_097 "Architecture surrounds and shelters us. " )
( NAN_098 "It is the real world, but it is also a vision. " )
( NAN_099 "The buildings are different, yet the three architects have something in common. " )
( NAN_1000 "In all cases, one senses a secular trend for diversity to increase. " )
( NAN_100 "They are serious about what they are doing, that is, their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction. " )
( NAN_101 "Sociocultural theory is unique in viewing inner mental activity as profoundly social. " )
( NAN_102 "The thoughts and imaginings that make us distinctly human are not regarded as independently constructed by the child. " )
( NAN_103 "Rather, the child derives them from his or her history of relations with other people. " )
( NAN_104 "Notice how, in scaffolding Sydney's puzzle solving, her father adapts the instruction he offers to Sydney's momentary competence. " )
( NAN_105 "When Sydney has difficulty, he fortifies the scaffold, providing increased direction. " )
( NAN_106 "Once Sydney starts to take over strategies generated during joint problem solving, her father pulls back, reducing the assistance provided. " )
( NAN_107 "Each narrative focused on a relatively exceptional personal experience. " )
( NAN_108 "And in each, my partners and I addressed the legitimacy of characters' intentions, weighing personal desire against socially acceptable behavior. " )
( NAN_109 "Through dialogues with adults, the child derives not just a self, but a self imbued with culture. " )
( NAN_110 "The stories, both real and fictional, that parents and teachers relate to or jointly construct with young children are laced with cultural beliefs and values. " )
( NAN_111 "They have profound socializing implications. " )
( NAN_112 "Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts, swimming, piano, and other lessons. " )
( NAN_113 "We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made, but they couldn't compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. " )
( NAN_114 "We almost never sat down to a meal together, or went places together; we each went our own way. " )
( NAN_115 "Between one and two years of age, children begin to acquire language, greater understanding of the consequences of their actions, and the ability to comply with others' requests and directives. " )
( NAN_116 "Consequently, caregivers' expectations change. " )
( NAN_117 "They increasingly insist that children engage in socially appropriate conduct. " )
( NAN_118 "During the very period in which children must learn to subordinate their desires to social life, imaginative play flourishes. " )
( NAN_119 "On Friday nights, they marked the Sabbath in a special way, by imagining that they were at home. " )
( NAN_120 "They talked about the evening's events in minute detail to make the image of family life firm and real. " )

( NAN_122 "It determines the information considered in any task and whether the task will be completed. " )
( NAN_123 "With respect to writing, object substitutions and role play seem to have special benefits. " )
( NAN_124 "Frequently using objects to symbolize other objects and transforming oneself into various characters may encourage children to try to make sense of other symbol systems. " )
( NAN_125 "Siblings frequently articulate how they themselves feel. " )
( NAN_126 "Therefore, siblings more often expose the child to the inner states of someone other than the child himself or herself. " )
( NAN_127 "The more affectionate and cooperative siblings' relationships are, the more sophisticated their sociodramatic play. " )
( NAN_128 "Filmstar Charlie Chaplin's mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer. " )
( NAN_129 "As a young child, Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. " )
( NAN_130 "As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlie's pretending. " )
( NAN_131 "Around age two, mothers begin to talk about nonexistent fantasy objects. " )
( NAN_132 "In one instance, a mother suggested that an empty bowl was full of juicy oranges, one for each of her son's miniature zoo animals. " )
( NAN_133 "This change may help children increase the range and complexity of their play symbols. " )
( NAN_134 "The physical context of children's play is important, because it shapes play themes and opportunities to interact with agemates. " )
( NAN_135 "Consequently, it can have a profound impact on what children learn. " )
( NAN_136 "By the end of this period, children formulate and implement strategies and cooperate more effectively in games. " )
( NAN_137 "They have also become interested in competition. " )
( NAN_138 "With respect to quantity, children's behavior can tell us whether they have too many or too few toys. " )
( NAN_139 "An excess of toys overwhelms and overstimulates. " )
( NAN_140 "The child whose bedroom is piled high with all the latest playthings is likely to cherish and play with few of them. " )
( NAN_141 "Praise should be tied to real progress and attainment. " )
( NAN_142 "Encouraging words are particularly helpful when children are trying their best but gains in performance are hard won. " )
( NAN_143 "And most children greatly appreciate a parent's congratulations for a job well done. " )
( NAN_144 "However, computers by themselves do not help children master the mechanics of writing, such as spelling and grammar. " )
( NAN_145 "Consequently, they are best used to build on, not replace, other writing experiences. " )
( NAN_146 "By the time Carl reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. " )
( NAN_147 "The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. " )
( NAN_148 "He did well in school, and became enthusiastically involved in several activities. " )
( NAN_149 "Children display wide individual differences in the quality of their sibling ties. " )
( NAN_150 "Once again, temperament makes a difference. " )
( NAN_151 "For example, arguments between siblings increase when one child is emotionally intense and highly active. " )
( NAN_152 "The most common cause of early language problems is a hearing loss. " )
( NAN_153 "Typically, children with hearing impairments are not identified until twelve to twenty five months of age, when speech and language development is already delayed. " )

( NAN_155 "This, admittedly, is an unusual take in our rigorously secular academic world. " )
( NAN_156 "The American university world has distanced itself from the sensibilities of ordinary Americans who take the Bible seriously as a source of wisdom, and who live their lives with devotion to values of faith and redemption. " )
( NAN_157 "In this interpretation of law as the path to national redemption, I seek to find a middle way between Jewish and Christian thinking. " )
( NAN_158 "Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. " )
( NAN_159 "We are met on a great battlefield of that war. " )
( NAN_160 "We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. " )
( NAN_161 "The notion of the nation and the fact of death root us in the past. " )
( NAN_162 "These are irreversible facts. " )
( NAN_163 "The nation is born of history; the dead link us to time past. " )
( NAN_164 "War has a democratizing influence. " )
( NAN_165 "Men fight side by side, and when they lay down their arms, they expect to be able to rule side by side. " )
( NAN_166 "It is not surprising then that in the aftermath of the Civil War, we find a new commitment to government by all the people. " )
( NAN_167 "The infinite dignity of the potential victim generates an absolute ban on killing. " )
( NAN_168 "The dignity of the victim is as great as any person who might wish to kill him and, therefore, the homicide of an innocent is never justified. " )
( NAN_169 "There is much to be said for Black's interpretation of the constitutional text. " )
( NAN_170 "He brings together strands of our legal culture; that until his writing seemed to lack internal coherence. " )
( NAN_171 "He grounds his argument in the familiar rhetoric of rights. " )
( NAN_172 "The faith in the American nation, along with the inalienable right to happiness, constitute affirmations of the American civic religion. " )
( NAN_173 "They belong side by side with the frequent invocations, on the currency of the affirmation of faith: In God We Trust. " )
( NAN_174 "These are the background assumptions by which we live. " )
( NAN_175 "In order for a state to have duties toward its own citizens, the citizens must be considered as members of some entity higher than the state to be held accountable. " )
( NAN_176 "In other words, the citizen and the state must both be considered as subjects of a higher legal order. " )
( NAN_177 "Yet, the values of nationhood and equality would not remain forever hidden, camouflaged in the deep structure of constitutional thought. " )
( NAN_178 "They would begin to reassert themselves, both in the political arena, and in the courts. " )
( NAN_179 "And the particular persons who enforced the color bar at trains, inns, and theaters were not agents of the state. " )
( NAN_180 "Their actions did not constitute legislation by any government, or executive action by any official wearing a badge of state authority. " )
( NAN_181 "The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. " )
( NAN_182 "It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. " )
( NAN_183 "And more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society. " )
( NAN_184 "If we think of the Civil War as a moral drama, we can not but perceive a government at work that is committed to the dignity of all. " )
( NAN_185 "The drama can be narrowly understood as an enormous sacrifice of human life to liberate people held in the most demeaning condition imaginable. " )
( NAN_186 "The war snuffed out one life, one being created in the image of God, for every seven slaves freed. " )
( NAN_187 "The policy of deferring to voluntary initiative has been more effective. " )
( NAN_188 "A revolution in attitudes toward smoking has occurred, largely because people were free, in effect, to decide for themselves in their homes, offices, and other spheres of influence. " )

( NAN_193 "The federal government had the duty to protect them. " )
( NAN_194 "There are obviously some areas where we must rely on the government, or on no one. " )
( NAN_195 "Only the federal government could have waged the Civil War and emancipated the powerless. " )
( NAN_196 "Only the federal government could secure the franchise to those who had no power on the local level. " )
( NAN_197 "Only the federal courts can secure equal protection of the laws when the states decide to disfavor some of their citizens. " )
( NAN_198 "But in other areas of life, the government can further its ends by staying its hand. " )
( NAN_199 "Academic critics of the decision stress the value of regulating speech that has the effect, it is argued, of silencing minorities. " )
( NAN_200 "The overriding value, they claim, is the equality of those affected by hate speech. " )
( NAN_201 "Only by restricting intimidating speech, the argument goes, can all potential participants in the democratic dialogue feel free to speak, and to make their opinions known. " )
( NAN_202 "The danger in the argument of human dignity is that it carries the risk of dogmatism. " )
( NAN_203 "In the face of the conviction that the peep show violates the dignity of the women who choose to participate, there is little one can say. " )
( NAN_204 "The marketplace of economic relationships is not what it seems to be. " )
( NAN_205 "Workers enter into seemingly voluntary contracts with employers, but underlying this system of apparent cooperation is a vast system of exploitation. " )
( NAN_206 "Those who hold capital reap profits off the backs of those whom they hire as their laborers. " )
( NAN_207 "This generates a dynamic of history that should, according to the theory, eventually produce a revolution by the exploited class of laborers. " )

( NAN_212 "If they need the assistance of a physician to be able to die with dignity, they should have that right. " )
( NAN_213 "The contrary view stresses the dangers of manipulated consent. " )
( NAN_214 "The third connection between dress and decor concerns perception. " )
( NAN_215 "Architecture, interior decoration, and fashion design are three distinct fields, yet we experience them with the same eye. " )
( NAN_216 "Whether we look at dress or decor, we bring the same visual bias, the same sensibility, the same taste. " )
( NAN_217 "This sensibility is not constant. " )
( NAN_218 "Sometimes we appreciate simplicity, sometimes complexity. " )
( NAN_219 "In the food court, the bar and counter tops were marble, the dining tables solid maple. " )
( NAN_220 "Students were gathered around tables, lounging on the staircase, sprawled on the floor. " )
( NAN_221 "The atmosphere was hard to pin down. " )
( NAN_222 "That is why old buildings are precious, that is why we fight to preserve them. " )
( NAN_223 "It is not only because we think them beautiful, or significant. " )
( NAN_224 "It is also because they remind us of who we once were. " )
( NAN_225 "And of who we might be again, for old buildings also inspire. " )
( NAN_226 "With the rediscovery of Greek and Roman Classicism, Gothic became distinctly unfashionable. " )
( NAN_227 "The old monuments were preserved, but they were not admired. " )
( NAN_228 "As Braun suggests, changes in fashion imply not only the creation of something new, but the destruction of something old. " )
( NAN_229 "That is why new fashions are inevitably upsetting. " )
( NAN_230 "The headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple. " )
( NAN_231 "In the past, religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range. " )
( NAN_232 "As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings, warehouses, factories, shops and cinemas, houses and weekend houses, a single style no longer sufficed. " )
( NAN_233 "The function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor, and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing. " )
( NAN_234 "There are dozens of ways that this can be done. " )
( NAN_235 "Baseboards can be prominent or discreet, a complicated assembly of board, cap and base, or a simple strip of hardwood. " )
( NAN_236 "A functionalist style pervades the house. " )
( NAN_237 "The clinical cabinetwork is white-painted wood. " )
( NAN_238 "A concrete wall in the dining room is bare, save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour line marks. " )
( NAN_239 "No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. " )
( NAN_240 "Yet they bear comparison. " )
( NAN_241 "They were both late bloomers. " )
( NAN_242 "Although sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehry's buildings, like Hunt, he keeps technology off center stage. " )
( NAN_243 "In that regard, he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects. " )
( NAN_244 "Neither is he nostalgic about the past. " )
( NAN_245 "Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism. " )
( NAN_246 "The law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of persons apprehended and charged. " )
( NAN_247 "Investigators and prosecutors could not present all the evidence of possible involvement of individuals other than those charged, although they continued to pursue such investigations, planning or hoping for later prosecutions. " )
( NAN_248 "The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection effort. " )
( NAN_249 "It called for a nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection, analysis, and dissemination. " )
( NAN_250 "It envisioned the creation of a professional intelligence cadre of experienced and trained agents and analysts. " )
( NAN_251 "Inspectors at the ports of entry were not asked to focus on terrorists. " )
( NAN_252 "Inspectors told us that they were not even aware that when they checked the names of incoming passengers against the automated watchlist, they were checking in part for terrorists. " )
( NAN_253 "In general, border inspectors also did not have the information they needed to make fact-based determinations of admissibility. " )
( NAN_254 "Terrorists, in turn, have benefited from this same rapid development of communication technologies. " )
( NAN_255 "They simply could buy off the shelf and harvest the products of a three trillion dollars a year telecommunication industry. " )
( NAN_256 "They could acquire without great expense communication devices that were varied, global, instantaneous, complex, and encrypted. " )
( NAN_257 "In many cases, the surge officers had little familiarity with the new issues. " )
( NAN_258 "Inevitably, some parts of the world and some collection targets were not fully covered, or not covered at all. " )
( NAN_259 "The concern about security vastly complicated information sharing. " )
( NAN_260 "Information was compartmented in order to protect it against exposure to skilled and technologically sophisticated adversaries. " )
( NAN_261 "The Department of Defense is the behemoth among federal agencies. " )
( NAN_262 "With an annual budget larger than the gross domestic product of Russia, it is an empire. " )

( NAN_264 "The civilian secretary of defense has ultimate control, under the president. " )
( NAN_265 "As the national security advisor's function expanded, the procedures and structure of the advisor's staff, conventionally called the National Security Council staff, became more formal. " )
( NAN_266 "The advisor developed recommendations for presidential directives, differently labeled by each president. " )
( NAN_267 "Several points about Congress are worth noting. " )
( NAN_268 "First, Congress always has a strong orientation toward domestic affairs. " )
( NAN_269 "It usually takes on foreign policy and national security issues after threats are identified and articulated by the administration. " )
( NAN_270 "The Bin Ladin station was already working on plans for offensive operations against Bin Ladin. " )
( NAN_271 "These plans were directed at both physical assets and sources of finance. " )
( NAN_272 "In the end, plans to identify and attack Bin Ladin's money sources did not go forward. " )
( NAN_273 "Mike thought the capture plan was the perfect operation. " )
( NAN_274 "It required minimum infrastructure. " )
( NAN_275 "Tenet told us that given the recommendation of his chief operations officers, he alone had decided to turn off the operation. " )
( NAN_276 "He had simply informed Berger, who had not pushed back. " )
( NAN_277 "Berger's recollection was similar. " )
( NAN_278 "He said the plan was never presented to the White House for a decision. " )
( NAN_279 "Everyone involved in the decision had, of course, been aware of President Clinton's problems. " )
( NAN_280 "He told them to ignore them. " )
( NAN_281 "Berger recalled the President saying to him that they were going to get crap either way, so they should do the right thing. " )
( NAN_282 "All his aides testified to us that they based their advice solely on national security considerations. " )
( NAN_283 "We have found no reason to question their statements. " )
( NAN_284 "The status of the document was and remained uncertain. " )
( NAN_285 "It was never formally adopted by the principals, and participants in the Small Group now have little or no recollection of it. " )
( NAN_286 "It did, however, guide Clarke's efforts. " )
( NAN_287 "The military component of Clarke's plan was its most fully articulated element. " )
( NAN_289 "Several intelligence reports, some of dubious sourcing, mentioned Washington as a possible target. " )
( NAN_290 "Early drafts of this highly sensitive document emphasized that it authorized only a capture operation. " )
( NAN_291 "The tribals were to be paid only if they captured Bin Ladin, not if they killed him. " )
( NAN_292 "Officials throughout the government approved this draft. " )
( NAN_293 "They were dubious about a quick strike approach to using Special Operations Forces, which they thought complicated and risky. " )
( NAN_294 "Such efforts would have required bases in the region, but all the options were unappealing. " )
( NAN_295 "Because this was not in an urban area, missiles launched against it would have less risk of causing collateral damage. " )
( NAN_296 "On February eighth, the military began to ready itself for a possible strike. " )
( NAN_297 "The next day, national technical intelligence confirmed the location and description of the larger camp and showed the nearby presence of an official aircraft of the United Arab Emirates. " )
( NAN_298 "But the military officer quoted earlier recalled that the Pentagon had been willing to act. " )
( NAN_299 "He told us that Clarke informed him and others that Tenet assessed the chance of the intelligence being accurate as fifty fifty. " )
( NAN_300 "This officer believed that Tenet's assessment was the key to the decision. " )
( NAN_301 "Attorney General Reno again expressed concerns on policy grounds. " )
( NAN_302 "She was worried about the danger of retaliation. " )
( NAN_303 "The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next two hundred centuries. " )
( NAN_304 "The glaciers feeding the lake melted away, and the lake evaporated. " )
( NAN_305 "Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. " )
( NAN_306 "These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. " )
( NAN_307 "The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. " )
( NAN_308 "Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. " )
( NAN_309 "Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and six hundred and forty acres surrounding it, dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch. " )
( NAN_310 "He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land, so that it would support crops and cattle. " )
( NAN_311 "His determination had other results as well: Gass was named a justice of the peace, and a territorial legislator. " )
( NAN_312 "At the turn of the nineteenth century, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West. " )
( NAN_313 "Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to change quickly. " )
( NAN_314 "When it did, the Las Vegas Valley, which at the time had a non-native population of less than thirty, would change as well. " )
( NAN_315 "Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement. " )
( NAN_316 "With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town. " )
( NAN_317 "Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city, in which many of the early settlers had lived. " )
( NAN_318 "One year after the auction, the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to one thousand and five hundred residents, a portent of things to come for the next ninety years. " )
( NAN_319 "Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day. " )
( NAN_320 "This originated Las Vegas's reputation as an adult theme park. " )
( NAN_321 "As corporations moved in, and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. " )
( NAN_323 "What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. " )
( NAN_324 "Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. " )
( NAN_325 "The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the comprehensive resort. " )
( NAN_326 "New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques. " )
( NAN_327 "Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else. " )
( NAN_328 "With its new look and new aim, the prospects are good despite the warnings. " )
( NAN_329 "Inevitably, some people will get burned in the process, but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes. " )
( NAN_330 "And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes the past, present, and future of Las Vegas. " )
( NAN_331 "In a town where spending time in traffic is to be avoided at all costs, one-stop shopping is essential. " )
( NAN_332 "Enter the realm of shopping malls, where everything you are looking for is available without moving your car. " )
( NAN_333 "Flea markets are where you will find merchants selling antiques, old Levi's, and every kind of junk imaginable. " )
( NAN_334 "They are held periodically throughout the city. " )
( NAN_335 "If you are a driving fan, the time to be here is April, when the Toyota Grand Prix auto race is held in Long Beach. " )
( NAN_336 "Every year, it attracts drivers and spectators from around the world. " )
( NAN_337 "For a closer spot to check out nature, visit Griffith Park, which has miles of trails for cycling, jogging and horseback riding. " )
( NAN_338 "Do keep in mind, however, that visitors should come during daylight, and stay in areas where there are lots of people; secluded areas in the park are less safe. " )
( NAN_339 "You know all that wild nightlife you have seen in movies about Hollywood. " )
( NAN_340 "Just take a drive along the Sunset Strip, and you will know what inspired the reputation. " )
( NAN_342 "There is virtually every type of entertainment imaginable here. " )
( NAN_343 "All you have to do is know where to find it. " )
( NAN_344 "Coffeehouses are everywhere, many offering live entertainment and poetry readings. " )
( NAN_345 "Some of the best are clustered in Santa Monica, and in West Hollywood. " )
( NAN_346 "Paramount Studios is the only major motion picture studio still physically located in Hollywood. " )
( NAN_347 "If peeking in through the wrought-iron gates isn't enough shoulder-rubbing with stardom for you, you can view the back lot on a walking tour. " )
( NAN_348 "The museum also features a fishbowl laboratory where visitors can see fossils being cleaned and catalogued. " )
( NAN_349 "The peaceful atrium nurtures primitive plants, several of which have evolved over a period of one hundred million years. " )
( NAN_350 "Some two hundred showrooms are housed here, and in the adjoining Green Center, which displays an impressive range of traditional and contemporary home and office furniture created by famous designers. " )
( NAN_351 "The showrooms are for trade only, meaning the only way you can make purchases is to buy through an interior designer. " )
( NAN_352 "Visitors are welcome to browse weekdays from nine to five. " )
( NAN_353 "Here, luxurious homes and landscaped lawns sit on some of the most expensive real estate in the world. " )

( NAN_357 "At the turn of the century, the land was practically worthless, covered with failed oil wells and fields of lima beans. " )
( NAN_358 "But in nineteen twelve, when a group of developers built the Beverly Hills Hotel, everything changed. " )
( NAN_359 "At least one historically fashionable establishment still resides here in all its glory. " )
( NAN_360 "The Regent Beverly Wilshire has been a landmark since nineteen twenty eight. " )
( NAN_361 "The luxury hotel is still a favorite of celebrities and visiting royalty, some of whom have been known to rent entire floors for their stay. " )
( NAN_362 "Santa Monica Pier, site of the famous carousel as well as the La Monica Ballroom, was built in nineteen oh eight. " )
( NAN_363 "Much of this historic structure was demolished by storms in nineteen eighty three, prompting restoration to its original look. " )

( NAN_365 "Make time for this California happening if you possibly can. " )
( NAN_366 "A few miles farther is the turn-off for Will Rogers State Historic Park, a ranch that belonged to the late cowboy humorist. " )
( NAN_367 "Tours of the ranch house reveal some of Rogers' eccentricities, namely a porch swing in the living room, and a raised ceiling that allowed him to practice rope tricks indoors. " )
( NAN_368 "Rogers was an enthusiastic horseman, and an experienced polo player. " )
( NAN_369 "Weekend games are still held on the polo field in the front yard. " )
( NAN_370 "A core of beautiful historic buildings, good restaurants, and colorful ethnic enclaves makes for excellent daytime exploration. " )
( NAN_371 "Several stellar performing arts venues and the centers of politics and finance also draw attention. " )

( NAN_374 "Since nineteen seventeen, Grand Central Market has provided the city with a daily cornucopia of enticing fresh produce, fish, poultry, meat, and exotic foodstuffs. " )
( NAN_375 "Today, dozens of stalls display a wonderful ethnic diversity: you can sample everything from fresh tortillas to Chinese herbs. " )
( NAN_376 "It is a great place for browsing and a quick snack, or inexpensive lunch. " )
( NAN_377 "The Japanese counterpart, Little Tokyo, is situated east of downtown on the streets around First and Central. " )

( NAN_381 "Pasadena soon became a popular resort area. " )
( NAN_382 "The Pacific Asia Museum has been designed to resemble a Chinese imperial residence. " )
( NAN_383 "It houses galleries of traditional and contemporary Asian art as well as a Chinese courtyard garden. " )
( NAN_384 "Since nineteen fifty five, when Walt Disney opened the doors of his Magic Kingdom, Disneyland has become one of the world's most popular tourist attractions. " )
( NAN_385 "As you pass through the gates, you enter a land of animated characters and technological wizardry, created by one of the most delightful imaginations that ever lived. " )
( NAN_386 "Disneyland is huge, and can be very crowded in summer. " )
( NAN_387 "Expect long waits for popular attractions, and heavy crowds on Main Street two hours before the parade. " )
( NAN_388 "During high season, arrive when the park opens, and hit the most popular attractions before the lines get too long. " )
( NAN_389 "Walter had a keen interest in the old West and, in order to create a diversion for the ravenous patrons, began building a ghost town. " )
( NAN_390 "It was a slow process; many of its buildings were brought piece by piece from abandoned desert towns. " )

( NAN_397 "These include coastal cruises, and a glass-bottomed boat trip to view the colorful fish and marine plant life. " )
( NAN_398 "In the Soviet Union, fundamental science was supported to a great extent by military expenditure. " )
( NAN_399 "Thus, it is not surprising that Soviet physics and mathematics were more successful than other fields, such as biology. " )
( NAN_400 "However, some laboratories are conducting outsourced research, and there are now research outposts of Western and Japanese companies in Russia organized as standard industrial labs. " )
( NAN_401 "On one hand, this work is a dead end for Russian scientists, because the results of such research normally can not be published. " )
( NAN_402 "This is a serious problem, especially for young scientists who want to establish themselves. " )
( NAN_403 "On the other hand, royalties from patents or commercialization of the products can be used to support further research. " )
( NAN_404 "Having the funds to purchase modern equipment abroad is only the first hurdle; the many conflicting rules and restrictions, inefficiency, and corruption within the system can subsequently hold up the process. " )
( NAN_405 "Some items, such as tissue samples or animals, are virtually impossible to import legally. " )
( NAN_406 "The process of clearing the shipments through customs is a difficult, time-consuming job. " )
( NAN_407 "What can be done by the international community to support what is left of Russian science? " )
( NAN_408 "Of course, direct support in the form of competitive grants is important, especially if there are few restrictions on spending; even the most carefully considered procedure can not foresee all possible situations. " )
( NAN_409 "The contribution of the international community can not be the sole decisive factor in the future growth of Russian science. " )
( NAN_410 "Important as it is in this transition period, it is no substitute for a systemic change. " )
( NAN_411 "Competition was designed to improve quality. " )
( NAN_412 "And I think that will be its lasting legacy; the fact that it has improved quality over the last seven years, and it will continue to do so. " )
( NAN_413 "Today, in most parts of our country, the partnerships between legal services programs and the private bar are deep and true. " )
( NAN_414 "Private lawyers have an enhanced understanding of the importance of our work. " )
( NAN_415 "We, in turn, understand the vital role they play in helping to assure that no client goes unserved. " )
( NAN_416 "These are pretty serious problems. " )
( NAN_417 "At times, they even appear insurmountable. " )
( NAN_418 "But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to address them in a proactive and straight-on manner. " )
( NAN_419 "We didn't realize how long it was going to take before we would begin to see some successes. " )
( NAN_420 "And then we failed to celebrate those successes as important milestones and victories. " )
( NAN_421 "Planning is not an end. " )
( NAN_422 "It is a means to an end and you must clearly and consistently articulate the end that you envision. " )
( NAN_423 "Programs and program directors responded to these concerns in different ways. " )
( NAN_424 "Some pursued strategic planning initiatives. " )
( NAN_425 "Others engaged in aggressive resource development, pursued alternative methods of providing legal services to clients, reconfigured their organizations, or in some instances, took their skills and talents elsewhere. " )
( NAN_426 "And unfortunately, too many of us did nothing. " )
( NAN_427 "In the end, actions do speak louder than words. " )
( NAN_428 "It doesn't really matter if we talk about state planning, or state justice communities, or worldclass delivery systems, or the creation of comprehensive, integrated and coordinated legal services delivery systems. " )
( NAN_429 "It just matters that we do it. " )
( NAN_430 "Over the past six years, many states have developed a range of initiatives aimed at expanding access and improving services to clients. " )
( NAN_431 "Their achievements, like the planning processes they have followed, have varied according to local circumstances, challenges, and opportunities. " )
( NAN_432 "As expected, one size truly does not fit all. " )
( NAN_433 "However, there have been important similarities in terms of successes. " )
( NAN_434 "In nineteen ninety nine, California appropriated, for the first time, ten million dollars for legal services. " )
( NAN_435 "The same amount was appropriated in Fiscal Year two thousand. " )
( NAN_436 "A fifty percent increase to fifteen million dollars is expected for two thousand and one. " )
( NAN_437 "In November nineteen ninety nine, the first-ever meeting of all of these programs was held. " )
( NAN_438 "The Legal Services Corporation provided funding for two facilitators and lodging and meal costs were paid for by the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. " )
( NAN_439 "The programs met for two days to plan areas of need and cooperation. " )
( NAN_440 "Working groups were established to coordinate training statewide, to focus on the establishment of a statewide website, and to continue coordination and sharing in technology matters. " )
( NAN_441 "A second portal would provide information and video streaming training for pro bono attorneys. " )
( NAN_442 "The final portal would provide access for legal services staff to training materials, discussion groups, legal research, and other matters. " )
( NAN_443 "The study completed in mid two thousand found strengths and accomplishments, and noted many remarkable features from which other states could learn. " )
( NAN_444 "It also identified some lost opportunities. " )
( NAN_445 "A preliminary evaluation of Phase one, currently under way, has found that many users are happy with the overall implementation of the technology plan to date, and believe that it has significantly improved their program's capacity, and their own individual capacity to serve clients. " )
( NAN_446 "Many users consider the implementation of the plan to have made a profound difference in the way they do their jobs. " )
( NAN_447 "Many users commented on the effectiveness of the new technology in promoting closer relationships among providers. " )
( NAN_448 "A new state support center has been created to engage in legislative monitoring and advocacy, training, coordination of statewide advocacy, collection and dissemination of information, and coordination of the system of substantive law taskforces. " )
( NAN_449 "A center director has been hired, and office space located. " )
( NAN_450 "The programs in Missouri are providing initial funding for the center. " )
( NAN_451 "A statewide system of seven substantive law taskforces is being put into place. " )
( NAN_452 "The seven issue areas are Consumer, Housing, Family, Income Maintenance and Health, Education, Immigration, and Disability. " )
( NAN_453 "The leaders of the taskforces will participate in the taskforce Leadership Council. " )
( NAN_454 "Each taskforce is developing statewide goals, strategies, and priorities. " )
( NAN_455 "The work of the taskforces will be showcased at an event celebrating the recent opening of the new state support center. " )
( NAN_456 "Within this framework, the plan laid out initiatives to improve, and streamline every aspect of the delivery system's operations. " )
( NAN_457 "The first priority was to continue to increase resources available for client services. " )
( NAN_458 "The second priority was to maximize the efficient and effective expenditure of these resources, and to achieve enhanced outcomes for clients by improving the core legal services delivery system. " )
( NAN_459 "There have been a number of successful statewide substantive law training conferences. " )
( NAN_460 "The statewide website has a calendar of training events and related information, and a statewide brief bank that can be accessed by all advocates is in the works. " )
( NAN_461 "A final Task Force Report was issued in nineteen ninety nine. " )
( NAN_462 "Since then, activities have been coordinated through an Access to Justice Network that includes all the entities involved in planning efforts. " )
( NAN_463 "Under the leadership of the State Bar's Campaign for Equal Justice, the state has had considerable success. " )
( NAN_464 "The Campaign has been raising more than six hundred thousand dollars a year from private attorneys. " )
( NAN_465 "Foundation funding accounts for an additional four hundred thousand dollars annually. " )
( NAN_466 "Building on a long history of close coordination of legal work, the programs collaborate through five taskforces: domestic relations, administrative law, housing, migrant and elder law. " )
( NAN_467 "The taskforces are facilitated by senior attorneys from the various programs, and meet quarterly. " )
( NAN_468 "All programs participate. " )
( NAN_469 "Co-counseling across programs occurs routinely, and expertise is regularly shared. " )
( NAN_470 "Now in its sixth year, the annual event has become the keystone event for the entire statewide equal justice community. " )
( NAN_471 "Each conference has generated a higher level of participation and sense of community. " )
( NAN_472 "There is no single model for building a state justice community. " )
( NAN_473 "States that are on the road to success have taken a variety of different approaches, based on particular circumstances, challenges, and opportunities. " )
( NAN_474 "People within a state must feel the need to, and some urgency for changing the legal services delivery system. " )
( NAN_475 "Shared values and vision impel the ongoing investment of time and energy that is necessary for success, and have enabled processes in a number of states to get past areas of disagreement. " )
( NAN_476 "Values and vision paint the picture that drives the action. " )
( NAN_477 "Ongoing evaluation of progress is important. " )
( NAN_478 "Openness, candor and frank feedback are essential. " )
( NAN_479 "State planning will fail unless there is acceptance of, and encouragement for the risks inherent in experimentation and innovation. " )
( NAN_480 "Obstacles and setbacks must be anticipated. " )
( NAN_481 "Changing a delivery system that has been in place for a quarter of a century is difficult. " )
( NAN_482 "It will take longer than you anticipate. " )
( NAN_483 "Skeptics will try to derail it. " )
( NAN_484 "The following are some tools and strategies employed effectively by states included in this Report. " )
( NAN_485 "This list is intended only to provide some useful examples; it does not purport to be a complete listing of all the states that have employed these tools. " )
( NAN_487 "They have not been getting much help, though, from their electronic stenographers: the computer programs that automatically convert intercepted conversations and broadcasts into transcripts. " )
( NAN_488 "That is because the speech recognition software that does the eavesdropping is still fairly primitive. " )
( NAN_489 "At most, it can identify individual words, but not periods, commas, sentences, or paragraphs, much less when a speaker is joking. " )
( NAN_490 "Clearly prosody is important in speech generated by machines, Ostendorf said. " )
( NAN_491 "Otherwise, the voices would sound like drones. " )
( NAN_492 "But creating machines that recognize prosody is going to be far more difficult, she said. " )
( NAN_493 "Here the program must factor in the intention of the speakers, and that is a lot harder than just figuring out words. " )
( NAN_494 "Shriber and her colleagues have mapped out some ways in which changes in pitch can signal sentence boundaries. " )
( NAN_495 "For example, she has devised models of angry sentences, which tend to have a higher overall pitch, and to end in a downward pitch, as well as being slower, and having a striking emphasis on certain words. " )
( NAN_496 "One useful pattern for detecting call-center rage is repetition, his research group has found. " )
( NAN_497 "For instance, when a person calling for flight information repeats a question several times using approximately the same wording, something has gone wrong. " )
( NAN_498 "Such a person might be connected to a human earlier, he said, before the anger sets in. " )
( NAN_499 "One project of Batliner's group went even further, using prosody to determine whether callers were inebriated. " )
( NAN_500 "We could detect the very sober and the very drunk with a high degree of accuracy, he said, although the clues were less reliable for people in between. " )
( NAN_501 "In my previous two books, I laid out some of the growing reasons to think that evolution was even richer than Darwin supposed. " )
( NAN_502 "Modern evolutionary theory has come to view selection as the sole source of order in biological organisms. " )
( NAN_503 "But the snowflake's delicate sixfold symmetry tells us that order can arise without the benefit of natural selection. " )
( NAN_504 "Instead, much of the order in organisms, I believe, is self-organized and spontaneous. " )
( NAN_505 "Self-organization mingles with natural selection in barely understood ways to yield the magnificence of our teeming biosphere. " )
( NAN_506 "We must, therefore, expand evolutionary theory. " )
( NAN_507 "I sensed my long search would uncover issues that were then only dimly visible to me. " )
( NAN_508 "I hoped the unfolding, ongoing notebook would allow me to find the themes, and link them into something that was vast and new, but at the time, inarticulate. " )
( NAN_509 "My second and core question became, What must a physical system be to be an autonomous agent? " )
( NAN_510 "Make no mistake, we autonomous agents mutually construct our biosphere, even as we coevolve in it. " )
( NAN_511 "Why and how this is so is a central subject of all that follows. " )
( NAN_512 "Any computer program is an algorithm that, given data, produces some sequence of output, finite or infinite. " )
( NAN_513 "Computer programs can always be written in the form of a binary symbol string of one and zero symbols. " )
( NAN_514 "All possible binary symbol strings are possible computer programs. " )
( NAN_515 "Hence, there is a countable, or denumerable, infinity of computer programs. " )
( NAN_516 "A theorem states that for most computer programs, there is no compact description of the printout of the program. " )
( NAN_517 "Rather, we must just unleash the program and watch it print what it prints. " )
( NAN_518 "In short, there is no shorter description of the output of the program than that which can be obtained by running the program itself. " )
( NAN_519 "On the other hand, no one designed and built the biosphere. " )
( NAN_520 "The biosphere got itself constructed by the emergence and persistent coevolution of autonomous agents. " )
( NAN_521 "If there can not be general laws for all open thermodynamic systems, might there be general laws for thermodynamically open but self-constructing systems such as biospheres? " )
( NAN_522 "I believe that the answer is yes. " )
( NAN_523 "So we confront a virtuous cycle: Work constructs constraints, yet constraints on the release of energy are required for work to be done. " )
( NAN_524 "Here is the heart of a new concept of organization that is not covered by our concepts of matter alone, energy alone, entropy alone, or information alone. " )
( NAN_525 "The answers appear not to be present in contemporary physics, chemistry, or biology. " )
( NAN_526 "But a coevolving biosphere accomplishes just this coconstruction of propagating organization. " )
( NAN_527 "We have much to investigate. " )
( NAN_528 "At the end, I think we will know more than at the outset. " )
( NAN_529 "But investigation is at best a mere beginning. " )
( NAN_530 "If an ink drop is placed in still water in a petri dish, it will diffuse to a uniform equilibrium distribution. " )
( NAN_531 "That uniform distribution is an average over an enormous number of atoms or molecules, and is not due to the behavior of individual molecules. " )
( NAN_532 "Any local fluctuations in ink concentration soon dissipate back to equilibrium. " )
( NAN_533 "If genes are constituted by as few as several hundred atoms, the familiar statistical fluctuations predicted by statistical mechanics would be so large that heritability would be essentially impossible. " )
( NAN_534 "Spontaneous mutations would happen at a frequency vastly larger than observed. " )
( NAN_535 "Quantum mechanics ensures that solids have rigidly ordered molecular structures. " )
( NAN_536 "A crystal is the simplest case. " )
( NAN_537 "But crystals are structurally dull. " )
( NAN_538 "The atoms are arranged in a regular lattice in three dimensions. " )
( NAN_539 "If you know the positions of all the atoms in a minimal-unit crystal, you know where all the other atoms are in the entire crystal. " )
( NAN_540 "This overstates the case, for there can be complex defects, but the point is clear. " )
( NAN_541 "Crystals have very regular structures, so the different parts of the crystal, in some sense, all say the same thing. " )
( NAN_542 "The stuff of the gene, he bets, is some form of aperiodic crystal. " )
( NAN_543 "The form of the aperiodicity will contain some kind of microscopic code that somehow controls the development of the organism. " )
( NAN_544 "The quantum character of the aperiodic solid will mean that small discrete changes, or mutations, will occur. " )
( NAN_545 "Natural selection, operating on these small discrete changes, will select out favorable mutations, as Darwin hoped. " )
( NAN_546 "I am not entirely convinced of what lies within this book; the material is too new and far too surprising to warrant conviction. " )
( NAN_547 "Yet the pathways I have stumbled along, glimpsing what may be a terra nova, do seem to me to be worth serious presentation and serious consideration. " )
( NAN_548 "One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since Newton. " )
( NAN_549 "Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed, literally something incalculable. " )
( NAN_550 "It will take a while to fully explore this definition. " )
( NAN_551 "Unpacking its implications reveals much that I did not remotely anticipate. " )
( NAN_552 "An early insight is that an autonomous agent must be displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium. " )
( NAN_553 "Work cycles can not occur at equilibrium. " )
( NAN_554 "Thus, the concept of an agent is inherently a nonequilibrium concept. " )
( NAN_555 "To begin to understand the molecular diversity revolution, consider a crude estimate of the total organic molecular diversity of the biosphere. " )
( NAN_556 "There are perhaps a hundred million species. " )
( NAN_557 "Humans have about a hundred thousand structural genes, encoding that many different proteins. " )
( NAN_558 "If all the genes within a species were identical, and all the genes in different species were at least slightly different, the biosphere would harbor about ten trillion different proteins. " )
( NAN_559 "Molecular diversity has now spread to the generation of high-diversity libraries of small organic molecules, an approach called combinatorial chemistry. " )
( NAN_560 "The promise is of high medical importance. " )
( NAN_561 "They conceived of an abstract shape space with perhaps seven or eight dimensions. " )
( NAN_562 "Three of these dimensions would correspond to the three spatial dimensions, length, height, and width of a molecular binding site. " )
( NAN_563 "Other dimensions might correspond to physical properties of the binding sites of molecules, such as charge, dipole moment, and hydrophobicity. " )
( NAN_564 "If an antibody covers a ball, an actual volume in shape space, then a finite number of balls will suffice to cover all of shape space. " )
( NAN_565 "A reasonable analogy is that a finite number of Pingpong balls will fill up a bedroom. " )
( NAN_566 "Not surprisingly, similar molecules can have similar shapes. " )
( NAN_567 "More surprisingly, very different molecules can have the same shape. " )
( NAN_568 "Examples include endorphin and morphine. " )
( NAN_569 "Endorphin is a peptide hormone. " )
( NAN_570 "When endorphin binds the endorphin brain receptor, a euphoric state is induced. " )
( NAN_571 "Morphine, a completely different kind of organic molecule, binds the endorphin receptor as well, with well-known consequences. " )
( NAN_572 "Physical chemists think of the substrate and product molecules as lying in two potential energy wells, like a ball at the bottom of one of two adjacent bowls. " )
( NAN_573 "A chemical reaction requires lifting the substrate energetically to the top of the barrier between the bowls. " )
( NAN_574 "Physically, the substrate's bonds are maximally strained and deformed at the top of this potential barrier. " )
( NAN_575 "The deformed molecule is called the transition state. " )
( NAN_576 "Life, at its core, depends upon autocatalysis, that is, reproduction. " )
( NAN_577 "Most catalysis in cells is carried out by protein enzymes. " )
( NAN_578 "Might there be general laws supporting the possibility that systems of catalytic polymers such as proteins might be self-reproducing? " )
( NAN_579 "Mutations are the feedstock of heritable variation in a population. " )
( NAN_580 "Populations evolve by mutation, mating, recombination, and selection to give the well-marked varieties that are, for Darwin, new species. " )
( NAN_581 "First, Darwin's theory of evolution is a theory of descent with modification. " )
( NAN_582 "It does not yet explain the genesis of forms, but the trimmings of the forms, once they are generated. " )
( NAN_583 "In Drosophila, many mutants make small modifications in bristle number, color, shape. " )
( NAN_584 "A few change wings to legs, eyes to antennae, heads to genitalia. " )
( NAN_585 "But it is not so obvious that recombination is a good idea after all. " )
( NAN_586 "At the molecular level, the recombination procedure is rather like taking an airplane and a motorcycle, breaking both in half, and using spare bolts to attach the back half of the airplane to the front half of the motorcycle. " )
( NAN_587 "The resulting contraption seems useless for any purpose. " )
( NAN_588 "In later chapters I will discuss the concept of a fitness landscape. " )
( NAN_589 "The basic idea is simple. " )
( NAN_590 "Consider a set of all possible frogs, each with a different genotype. " )
( NAN_591 "Locate each frog in a high-dimensional genotype space, each next to all genotypes that differ from it by a single mutation. " )
( NAN_592 "Imagine that you can measure the fitness of each frog. " )
( NAN_593 "Graph the fitness of each frog as a height above that position in genotype space. " )
( NAN_594 "The resulting heights form a fitness landscape over the genotype space, much as the Alps form a mountainous landscape over part of Europe. " )
( NAN_595 "In the absence of any knowledge or constraint on the fitness landscape, on average, any search procedure is as good as any other. " )
( NAN_596 "But life uses mutation, recombination, and selection. " )
( NAN_597 "These search procedures seem to be working quite well. " )
( NAN_598 "Think of an organism's niche as a way of making a living. " )
( NAN_599 "Call a way of making a living a natural game. " )
( NAN_600 "Then of course, natural games evolve with the organisms making those livings during the past four billion years. " )
( NAN_601 "What, then, are the winning games? " )
( NAN_602 "Naturally, the winning games are the games the winning organisms play. " )
( NAN_603 "So organisms, niches, and search procedures jointly and self-consistently coconstruct one another. " )
( NAN_604 "We make the world in which we make a living such that we can, and have, more or less mastered that evolving world as we make it. " )
( NAN_605 "The same is true, I will argue, for an econosphere. " )
( NAN_606 "A web of economic activities, firms, tasks, jobs, workers, skills, and learning, self-consistently came into existence in the last forty thousand years of human evolution. " )
( NAN_607 "Think of the Magna Carta, that cultural enterprise founded on a green meadow in England when John the First was confronted by his nobles. " )
( NAN_608 "British common law has evolved by precedent and determinations to a tangled web of more-or-less wisdom. " )
( NAN_609 "When a judge makes a new determination, sets a new precedent, ripples of new interpretation pass to near and occasionally far reaches of the law. " )
( NAN_610 "Were it the case that every new precedent altered the interpretation of all old judgments, the common law could not have coevolved into its rich tapestry. " )
( NAN_611 "Conversely, if new precedents never sent out ripples, the common law could hardly evolve at all. " )
( NAN_612 "The experiment requires a table and some sand. " )
( NAN_613 "Drop the sand slowly on the table. " )
( NAN_614 "The sand gradually piles up, fills the tabletop, piles to the rest angle of sand, then sand avalanches begin to fall to the floor. " )
( NAN_615 "Keep adding sand slowly to the sand pile, and plot the size distribution of sand avalanches. " )
( NAN_616 "You will obtain many small avalanches and progressively fewer large avalanches. " )
( NAN_617 "In the sand pile case, a straight line sloping downward to the right is obtained. " )
( NAN_618 "The slope is the power law relation between the size and number of avalanches. " )
( NAN_619 "In addition, the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. " )
( NAN_620 "The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. " )
( NAN_621 "Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. " )
( NAN_622 "Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. " )
( NAN_623 "As autonomous agents coconstruct a biosphere, each must manage to categorize and act upon its world in its own behalf. " )
( NAN_624 "What principles might govern that categorization and action, one might begin to wonder. " )
( NAN_625 "I suspect that autonomous agents coevolve such that each makes the maximum diversity of reliable discriminations upon which it can act reliably as it swims, scrambles, pokes, twists, and pounces. " )
( NAN_626 "Our universe is vastly nonrepeating; or, as the physicists say, the universe is vastly nonergodic. " )
( NAN_627 "Perhaps there are laws that govern this nonergodic flow. " )
( NAN_628 "Biospheres demand their Shakespeares as well as their Newtons. " )
( NAN_629 "We will have to rethink what science is itself. " )
( NAN_630 "And the humanities and science may find an unexpected, inevitable union. " )
( NAN_631 "A simple example of a device that detects displacements from equilibrium and extracts work is a windmill. " )
( NAN_632 "The vane on the windmill measures the direction of the wind, and pivots the windmill such that its fan blades are perpendicular to the wind. " )
( NAN_633 "In turn, the wind does work on the blades, causing the windmill to rotate. " )
( NAN_634 "The system as a whole measures a deviation from equilibrium, orients the entire system such that extraction of work by the wind is possible for the device, and it actually extracts work. " )
( NAN_635 "The windmill turns. " )
( NAN_636 "The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental. " )
( NAN_637 "A biosphere becomes complex, the universe becomes complex. " )
( NAN_638 "I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification. " )
( NAN_641 "But it will turn out that in any specific case of work, the specific process is organized in some specific way. " )
( NAN_643 "A conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery. " )
( NAN_644 "The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere. " )
( NAN_645 "Part of the answer lies in the concept of broken symmetries. " )
( NAN_646 "Consider a pole standing vertically on a horizontal plane. " )
( NAN_647 "In due course, it will fall over under the influence of gravity. " )
( NAN_648 "Prior to falling, its range of possible directions to fall is the full circle. " )
( NAN_649 "After it falls, it points in some specific direction. " )
( NAN_650 "By falling, the pole has broken the circular symmetry of the system and come to a specific orientation. " )
( NAN_651 "Maxwell's demon is almost an autonomous agent. " )
( NAN_652 "While the demon is not defined as I have done, you will soon see that he seems to be able to make decisions, and to act on the physical world. " )
( NAN_653 "I suspect it is more than a mere coincidence that Maxwell and we seem forced to use this kind of intentional language. " )
( NAN_654 "Multiply the logarithm of the number of microstates per macrostate by the probability that the system is in that macrostate. " )
( NAN_655 "Now add up all these quantities for all the macrostates. " )
( NAN_656 "The total is the entropy of the system. " )
( NAN_657 "One modern sense of a compact description of something is a computer program. " )
( NAN_658 "We are to think of the computer program as a calculating engine. " )
( NAN_659 "We give it initial input data. " )
( NAN_660 "It has some program, typically written as a sequence of binary numbers, and the program operates on the input data, also a string of binary symbols, and churns out an answer. " )
( NAN_661 "Then the concept of a compact description becomes the concept of the shortness of the symbol string giving the input data, and the shortness of the program. " )
( NAN_662 "Terrorists usually try to attack strong targets at their weakest point, security experts contend. " )
( NAN_663 "But if the shooting Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport was terrorism, then it was an attack on perhaps the airport's strongest point. " )
( NAN_664 "Israeli officials have been ratcheting up security on El Al since the nineteen sixties, when it became a target of attacks and hijackings. " )
( NAN_665 "The only successful hijacking of an El Al jet was in nineteen sixty eight, when a flight from Rome was diverted to Algiers by Palestinian nationalists. " )
( NAN_666 "Its passengers are unapologetically profiled. " )
( NAN_667 "While most Israeli Jews quickly pass through security inspection, Arabs and certain other foreigners are singled out for intense questioning. " )
( NAN_668 "I think we need to take a long look at all of our security procedures, he said. " )
( NAN_669 "We need to see what further steps should be taken to protect the entire terminal area. " )
( NAN_670 "No one answered the phone at the Aerial Sign Corporation Thursday night. " )
( NAN_671 "One of the company's planes was involved in a fatal accident at the airport on Monday, when it turned right shortly after takeoff, cartwheeled and exploded. " )
( NAN_672 "You shouldn't have jumped that subway turnstile, but it is too late for regrets. " )
( NAN_673 "You were caught and sentenced to community service. " )
( NAN_674 "Now comes the hard part. " )
( NAN_675 "Do you resign yourself to spending the weekend picking up trash along the highway, and hoping none of your friends cruise past while you are wearing that orange traffic vest? " )
( NAN_676 "Or do you try for a more genteel punishment, say, planting bulbs in Central Park? " )
( NAN_677 "But not all community service sentences are the same. " )
( NAN_678 "Choose the short stick, and you could do your time scraping human feces off the concrete beneath the Harlem River Drive overpasses. " )
( NAN_679 "If you are lucky, you could end up stuffing envelopes and sipping tea at the charity of your choice. " )
( NAN_680 "Whatever you do, avoid something called homeless removal. " )
( NAN_681 "This involves dismantling the temporary shelters along the highway put up by homeless people and cleaning the areas they have been using as latrines. " )
( NAN_682 "The highway cleanup details are a little better, but far from ideal. " )
( NAN_684 "Working in the parks is far more pleasant, several offenders said. " )
( NAN_685 "It is shady, and the work is mostly sweeping and raking, sometimes even pulling weeds and planting flowers. " )
( NAN_686 "One solution is to request a posting where you are not likely to run into friends and family. " )
( NAN_687 "Many of the Parks Department sites are in Staten Island, a safe bet for some Manhattan residents. " )
( NAN_688 "If your offense requires you to stick with subways, you can ask to clean the yards, which are generally in remote parts of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. " )
( NAN_689 "The ugly truth here is that money can help. " )
( NAN_690 "Community service may appear to be one of the great leveling experiences of modern life, like jury service or highway rest-stop bathrooms. " )
( NAN_691 "But if you are willing to pay for it, a lawyer can propose a custom sentence with a charity or nonprofit group. " )
( NAN_692 "For everyone else, it is not clear whether community service is more or less effective than jail at reducing recidivism, experts say. " )
( NAN_693 "It started out as a boutique sentence for white-collar offenders, and has evolved only over the past two decades into a standard punishment for people whose crimes merit something more than probation and less than prison. " )
( NAN_694 "Even now, fully one-third of those sentenced fail to show up, and many of them lose the option to perform community service and end up serving jail terms, Kluger said. " )
( NAN_695 "In theory, community service saves the city money by avoiding jail costs. " )
( NAN_696 "But it is hard to be sure, since many of those who are sentenced would have been let off with nothing in an earlier era, said Douglas Corry McDonald. " )
( NAN_697 "Bottarga is the pressed and salted roe of many kinds of fish. " )
( NAN_698 "It is important in the Mediterranean culture. " )
( NAN_699 "In Sicily they eat slices of it on ripe tomatoes. " )
( NAN_700 "Making bottarga is a way of preserving the roe of the fish that come in to spawn. " )
( NAN_701 "It gives you an idea of how every part of the fish is used. " )
( NAN_702 "You can get bottarga from tuna, mullet, ling, and hake. " )
( NAN_703 "I put the bottarga in the freezer to firm it up, so I can shave it on a mandolin. " )
( NAN_704 "You can also buy it grated, but I don't like it as much that way, and especially not in this dish, not with the bread crumbs. " )
( NAN_705 "Just remember to cook the pasta in well-salted water and time it a minute less than it says on the box. " )
( NAN_706 "The only way to tell if the pasta is done is to taste it. " )
( NAN_707 "It should be kind of firm when you take it out because you are also going to cook it in the sauce. " )
( NAN_708 "You need to finish your pasta in the sauce. " )
( NAN_709 "This sauce is hardly a sauce at all, just some garlic in olive oil, with a dried chili, some of the water from the pasta, and then the bread crumbs, pretty humble stuff. " )
( NAN_710 "You want to keep it a little wet because of the bread crumbs, and try to let the oil cool down a bit before you add the water, so it won't splash. " )
( NAN_711 "Drain pasta, reserving one cup of cooking water. " )
( NAN_712 "Pour water into skillet with chili and garlic, add drained pasta, return to medium heat, and simmer about a minute. " )

( NAN_717 "For women reaching menopause, decisions about hormone-replacement therapy seem to be getting more complicated. " )
( NAN_718 "New studies contradict old ones. " )
( NAN_719 "Books, web sites and advertisements for an array of products abound. " )
( NAN_720 "Recent studies have cast doubt on earlier research that suggested hormone replacement could prevent cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. " )
( NAN_721 "Those questions may not be resolved before two thousand and six, when results are expected from a large, federally financed study called the Women's Health Initiative. " )
( NAN_722 "The factions do agree that for certain problems, hormone therapy works well. " )
( NAN_723 "It is by far the best way to relieve menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, and it can ease the dryness and discomfort that may result from thinning of the vaginal lining. " )
( NAN_724 "Hormone replacement also decreases bone loss, though the benefit ends as soon as a woman stops taking the hormones. " )
( NAN_725 "Five years is a cutoff that many doctors recommend, because that is when studies start detecting an increased risk of breast cancer. " )
( NAN_726 "About eighty percent of the women who start taking hormones stop on their own within a few years. " )
( NAN_727 "Estrogen relieves menopausal symptoms, but taking it alone increases the risk of uterine cancer. " )
( NAN_728 "So, unless a woman has had her uterus removed, hormone replacement consists of a combination of estrogen and some form of another hormone, progesterone, which lowers the uterine risk. " )
( NAN_729 "Estrogen also comes in more than one form. " )
( NAN_731 "In the body, estrogens are made mostly by the ovaries, with small amounts formed in the adrenal glands. " )
( NAN_732 "Many of the claims for other estrogens are based on small studies, some without control groups. " )
( NAN_733 "Some are based on the success stories of individual doctors and patients, or on the idea that it makes sense to try to mimic the body's hormonal patterns as closely as possible. " )
( NAN_734 "Both Warren and Schiff said that for many women, a much more important decision was whether to take estrogen by mouth or through a skin patch. " )
( NAN_735 "Taken orally, estrogen goes through the stomach and intestine, and hits the liver in a high dose. " )
( NAN_736 "But when given through a patch, estrogen is absorbed directly into the bloodstream, as it is when secreted naturally. " )
( NAN_737 "It still reaches the liver, but not in high doses. " )
( NAN_738 "It is thought that the patch does not increase the clotting factors, and the risk for phlebitis should be reduced, Schiff said. " )

( NAN_782 "Of course, the one tax concept that we all understand is an audit. " )
( NAN_783 "The prospect of being audited may be one of life's most stressful experiences, so I can only imagine how daunting it would be, if I had to do so without any professional assistance. " )
( NAN_784 "But that is the exact situation that many low and moderate-income taxpayers face, when being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. " )

( NAN_840 "This state conducts its planning activities through ad hoc groups addressing discreet issues. " )
( NAN_841 "In this way they have involved the judiciary, the private bar, law schools, social services providers, court personnel, legal services staff and board members, and clients in their planning effort. " )
( NAN_842 "The Justice Action Group undertook responsibility for overseeing the work of a number of taskforces for specific issue areas. " )
( NAN_843 "The work of the taskforces was supported by the Legal Services Response Team, consisting of the directors of the legal services programs, and directors of the Bar Foundation and the Bar Association. " )

( NAN_928 "The agents base their economic actions on those beliefs. " )
( NAN_929 "A fixed point can exist under which the actions of the agents, given their beliefs about the economy, exactly create the expected economic behavior. " )
